## Clock

3mm micro bearings and 3mm shafts have arrived, so the plan is to fit them to the clock
on the escape wheel shaft and remontoire shafts.

First I'll print some bearing blocks, then try spinning the escape wheel in them and verify
that it works better than the existing micro bearings before proceeding.

Will need some way to mount wheels on 3mm shafts, maybe just sleeve the existing
mounts for now?

First impression is that these bearings are significantly poorer quality than the larger
ones. They have a massive amount of play and make quite a noise when spinning around. But
I'm printing a sleeve and will see how it goes.

The old ones are better! By quite a lot.

One confounder is that the shaft has larger moment of inertia, but I think not enough
to explain it. I think these new bearings are just no good.

I'll try a different brand. These ones are from "Saipor", I'm trying "Sourcing map".
Obviously they're all just "unbranded" Chinese ones, but we'll see.

If the "Sourcing map" ones are also no good then I guess we stick with the 5mm shafts
and move on to reducing friction in the balance. Or alternatively remove some balance weights
and weaken the balance spring, that would reduce the amount of drive weight required.
