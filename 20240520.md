## Machine building

I think I was wrong yesterday when I said the gantry needs shimming up at the left or right.
If the gantry is tilted left/right then our whole coordinate system tilts left/right and
we don't care. The top of the table will get surfaced down and everything will be fine, no?

I did shim up the left hand side with a bit of paper, but I'm not going to worry about
getting it very exact, I'll just mark the holes where they are now. I can still shim one side
forward/backward without losing the alignment with the bolt holes.

So plan is:

 * mark for gantry bolt holes
 * 3d print a drilling template
 * drill gantry bolt holes using marks & template
 * epoxy the inserts in
 * CAD for motor mounts

With the gantry clamped on I put a tiny drill mark in the top and bottom holes to mark the locations.
