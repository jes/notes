## Flywheel truck

Comparing this to some other flywheel car toys she has, I actually
think it would be better off with a higher gear ratio and less weight
on the flywheel.

So the plan is to put the old gears back on, but remove most of the
bolts from the flywheel.

Update: no, it's worse.

I think there is too much friction in the geartrain. Maybe I ought to
try again with 1 less gear in the train (so 2 stages of reduction
instead of 3), and either soak the bearings in alcohol to get the
grease out, or use 2mm pivot steel in plain bearings.

## Keenan Crane Discrete Differential Geometry course

I've started watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JCR6z3GLVI&list=PL9_jI1bdZmz0hIrNCMQW1YmZysAiIYSSS&index=2

At about 31m30s in lecture 1, we get the definition of the curvature
of a curve as the dot product of the normal of the curve and the
second derivative.

Isoform's edge detection is based on finding a large second
derivative. That corresponds to regions of high curvature.

The first thought that occurred is that I should actually be looking
for a large *third* derivative, i.e. regions where the *rate of change*
of curvature is large.

And the second thing is: why does he take the dot product of the normal
with the second derivative, instead of just the length of the second
derivative?

Apparently the reason is that it lets you "retain the information"
of whether it is bending towards the left or the right, and not
just the tightness.

Could be useful for distinguishing between "inside corner" edges
and "outside corner" edges? Maybe?

Annoyingly, my edge detection wants to highlight edges that have 0 size,
which means I really need to ask "is there a high
curvature anywhere within a 3-pixel screen-space radius?" or something
along those lines.

Or, really, a high *rate of change* of curvature.

## Automatic differentiation in Peptide

The way to do this is to have each node also be able to return
its first derivative.

So alongside `evaluate()`, we add `derivative()` or something,
that returns a *Peptide expression* for the first derivative. And then
for free we can do that multiple times to get the nth derivative.
