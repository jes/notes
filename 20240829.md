## CNC machine

I finished tapping the holes in the plate, deburred both sides, draw-filed both sides, and put the plate back on the machine:

That was a lot more work than I expected, but done now.

Still wants:

 * tram the spindle - I'm thinking I shim the X carriage instead of the gantry, easier to do and less contact area to cover
 * cable management in tub
 * grblHal
 * probably actual hose clamps instead of cable ties
 * automatically run the spindle coolant pump when the VFD is powered
