## Sovereign Scales

I'm following the plan from [2024-10-08](20241008.md).

The "vice stop" is a 5mm rod pushed all the way into the bottom of a hole
in the table surface, and then the brass pushed all the way up against it until
it won't lean any more. I expect this would wear the hole quite quickly but should
be OK for now. Pointy-end down.

Also the coolant pump is making fizzing noises, I think I need a more powerful pump.

I started running `top-1` at 10:01.

`surface-top` takes about 4 mins.

I blundered the first one, because I set X=-5.5 when the 5mm rod would slip between the tool
and the rough-cut end of the work - but I should have set X=-8.5 because it has a 3mm radius.

The pocketing toolpath leaves a nub in the centre of the half sovereign and quarter sovereign slots because the tool only
cuts at the circumference.

The `rectangle` finishing cut could happen in 2x 5.5mm steps instead of 2x 5.0mm and 1x 1.0mm.

`top-1` took 13 minutes in total.

After the first `top-1` it parked at X=-7.5, I updated this to say X=-10.5 so that the others will
be right.

After `top-1` it should move the tool back and up so that you can more easily work with the vice.

Result of `top-1`:

There are some minor chatter marks on the edges, I wonder if a ballnut holder is coming loose or something. Ignore for today.

Now 2 more copies of this, but with X offset corrected.

Moving the X coordinate by 3mm did not work very well, we lost about 4.5mm of material from the other end of
the part. Is my vice stop just super not repeatable at all? Or do I need to cut the material longer? Or review
the gcode? I moved it back by 1mm for the third part but it seemed basically the same as the second.

OK, got 3 copies of `top-1`. It's 10:44 now. On to `top-2`!

So changes in gcode/plan for `top-1` are:

1. make the rectangle finishing cut more efficient
2. fix the nub in the centre from the pocketing toolpath (maybe just adjust stepover so that it clears it out? and run a fixup job on these parts)
3. move the tool back after each job so that you can work with the vice/table
4. make a separate version of `top-2` without `surface-top` included, to save time on the first `top-2`
5. take the machine apart and Loctite all the fasteners
6. remove first lap of `counterweight` because it doesn't cut anything
7. machine down the right-hand edge all the way to the bottom, to use it as a reference
8. run a deburring toolpath
9. work out why the coordinate offset didn't work properly.

Pugsender idea: "Turbo" button. You just hold it down during parts you know can go faster and it runs at 200% feed until you let go.

For `top-2` we want shorter parallels, we only need 4mm or so of the actual part material protruding above the jaws (plus the excess
removed by `surface-top`.

Since my rectangle cut didn't go all the way to the bottom, it's inconvenient to zero against the left-hand edge. Instead I'll
touch off against the right-hand edge. Measuring another part, I get 147.29 mm for the overall length. Is that believable? Check CAD.
Should be 147.0 mm, but we leave on 0.5mm for material to remove, so it looks like it's made it too small by 0.2mm?

The width measures about 15.04mm, which is more like what you'd expect.
The length of the actual part measures 119.7mm, which is 0.3mm too small. Maybe something is wrong with the X axis? Check it another time.

I'll just touch off the right-hand edge and split the difference on the error.

So this X coordinate is 147mm for the length of the two parts, plus 0.5mm for the excess we left on, plus 5mm for the rod I used to
touch off, plus 3mm for the tool radius, minus 0.1mm for the X error = 155.4mm.

And then does that look like it has X=0 at about the right place? Looks close!

Either there is something badly wrong with the X axis, or I made a blunder while touching off Z in `surface-top` and accidentally
moved X instead. After completing `surface-top`, X=155.4 is nowhere near where it was before.

This could explain why my X offsets kept getting confused in `top-1`. Maybe the rapid during `surface-top` makes the X axis slip? Will
see if I can tighten up the coupler. I tightened it *slightly* but it didn't feel like it should be slipping.

I've parked at X0Y0Z10.

1. make a separate `surface-top` job that just cuts directly at Z=0, for fine-tuning the thickness
2. find the thickness by running a really short job at Z=1, waiting until that gives a 14mm thickness, then going straight into `top-2` with integrated `surface-top`
