## Sovereign Scales

I wondered how the counterweight would change if switched from aluminium to brass.

Brass is about 3.2x denser than aluminium.

So the torque of the metal on the coin side changes from 244 g mm to 781 g mm, plus the 160 g mm from the coin,
gives us **941 g mm** to balance.

The torque from the metal on the other side changes from "28.2 + 25.6X" g mm to "90.2 + 81.9X" g mm.

    90.2 + 81.9X = 941
    81.9X = 941 - 90.2 = 850.8
    X = 850.8 / 81.9 = 10.4mm

So the counterweight reduces from about 15mm to about 10mm? I would have expected better than that.
