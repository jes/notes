## Time tracker

I'm going to make the backend for this and make it actually usable, maybe deploy it to dojo.

The backend is just a Go program that saves/restores a JSON blob.

Great success, done.

## Sovereign Scales

I actually don't fancy working in the garage today after all, too cold and wet outside.

But let's try and make the gcode, and perhaps I'll be able to run it on Friday.

I think for gcode files that require manual editing I'll try to make shell scripts to turn the FreeCAD output
into what I want, and where that's not possible I'll have the shell script tell me what edits need to be made, so that
I have half a chance of iterating on this without having to rediscover everything every time.

I have a `gcode-cat` script that strips out trailing `M2` or `%` from individual files, and writes a trailing `M2` for
the concatenated output.

Some ideas to make sure I always use the right files:

 * name the FreeCAD Path "Job"s after the filename they will create (e.g. `top-profile.nc`)
 * put the generate Gcode into a separate directory (`out/`), so that when I copy them to the USB stick I only take completed files and not fragments

It is annoying that toggling visibility of a Job doesn't toggle visibility of the toolpaths/model inside it.

Job checklist:

 * tool
 * feeds/speeds
 * LinuxCNC
 * coordinate system (for the easy life, move the Body's so that they match the coordinate system of the Job's)
 * not hitting vice jaws
 * not damaging 2nd part

### top-1

Origin:

 * X: left hand edge of final part (free-ish choice, set left edge of rough material as X=-0.5)
 * Y: centre of final part
 * Z: top surface of final part (free-ish choice, set top surface of rough material as Z=1)

From memory the tall parallels end up 3.5mm below the top of the vice jaws.

`surface-top`: I think manually write a toolpath into a "header" file that surfaces off the top at Z=0. We can then reuse
this as a separate job run before top-2 so that we manually get the height correct.

`top-profile`: Make a profile in FreeCAD that does a profile of the part down to Z=-3.5 or whatever, and makes
the coin pockets. This one we'll leave intact.

`rectangle`: Make a profile in FreeCAD that does a profile of the 15mm width, from Z=-3.5 down to Z=-11, or something that will definitely
get cleared up by top-2. This should be a rectangle leaving 0.5mm extra on the bottom part's counterweight, except put the fillets on the edge of the top's counterweight.

`counterweight`: Then make a second profile in FreeCAD that does a profile of the bottom few mm of the counterweight only, down to Z=-16 or whatever,
deep enough that it will clear the entire material so that we can use it for centering top-2,
and then edit it by hand (?) to make it not cut through the middle of the part.

Then `gcode-cat` the four of them to get `top-1.nc`.

We can detect the path in `counterweight.nc` that would cut through the middle of the part, it's the one where
we move in a straight line from a positive Y coordinate to a negative one. Then we also want to delete the arc paths immediately
before and after it, and replace them with a hop up in Z, then move to the end of the final arc path, then hop
back down in Z.

Maybe get Cursor to write a script to do that? It wrote `counterweight-fix`. Got it wrong on the first try but easy
enough to fix. This is so good.

The script is behaving strangely, and I noticed that the toolpath actually doesn't fit the shape very well!
https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?style=4&t=36204 this page suggests there is a config setting to control the
toolpath accuracy. But it is currently 0.01 mm and can't be set any finer than that.

In this path: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5612

The curve around the sharp corner should transition to a short straight line segment, it shouldn't just
be curves connected together!

Maybe this will do: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5613

And here's the full `top-1.nc`: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5614

And with a representation of the vice jaws, it looks like we clear them OK: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5615

Good.

### top-2

Origin:

 * X: 0.5mm into the left-hand edge of the material (this is close to *but not the same as* what we did for `top-1`, because in `top-1` it was referenced against a rough cut edge; needs picking up again)
 * Y: centre of other side's counterweight
 * Z: 13mm above the bottom

This is the same as `top-1`, but without `rectangle.nc`? And remember the machined edge of this part's counterweight still leaves 0.5mm of material.

### Plan

 * chop the metal into 150mm chunks
 * load 6mm end mill
 * load first chunk, centred in vice
 * setup some vice-stop-type system for referencing the left hand edge
 * setup coordinates for `top-1`
 * run `top-1`
 * repeat for every chunk, using vice stop
 * setup coordinates for `top-2`
 * load first chunk, using vice stop
 * run `surface-top` by hand and measure thickness, we're after **13.00 mm**, adjust until good
 * run `top-2` for every chunk, using vice stop
 * adjust coordinate system by 0.5mm in X to account for the now-machined counterweight edge (what is currently X0 should become X0.5, so add 0.5 to displayed X coord)
 * load drag engraver
 * run `engraving` on both sides of every chunk, using vice stop
 * load 1mm end mill
 * run `slots` on both sides of every chunk, using vice stop
 * remove vice, setup a fixture plate with a repeatable method of holding the parts on their side, with clamping on the counterweights
 * pick up X/Y coordinates by pivot hole locations? let's say the top-left part's pivot hole is X0Y0?
 * load 1mm drill
 * run `pivot-holes` on every chunk
 * load 6mm end mill
 * run `separate-parts` on every chunk

Would be good to hook up the CNC PC to the NAS so that I don't have to use the USB stick method.

Todo gcode for:

 * `engraving`
 * `slots`
 * `pivot-holes`
 * `separate-parts`

Paul suggested putting serial numbers on, that's a fun idea. I wonder how I can avoid having to do gcodetools once for
every unique serial number?
