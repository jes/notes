## sngrep

Earlier today we saw https://github.com/irontec/sngrep segfault when presented
with a very-large (~60K) HEP packet.

Is this just an issue with old CentOS sngrep or is it current?

Can I reproduce it at home? Can I fix it?

I got Cursor to write me a HEP spamming tool. It got it almost right on the first try, then I copied the https://github.com/sipcapture/HEP/blob/master/docs/HEP3_Network_Protocol_Specification_REV_37.pdf
into the context and it got it totally right. What a time to be alive.

So now I need to make it send very large packets.

Yes! It reproduces the segfault. Great success. The code is now trash but if it reliably triggers the bug I don't care.

Interestingly, it *doesn't* reliably trigger the bug. It triggered it once but isn't doing it again. Annoying.

It has crashed again, only once more though, and slightly different, no "Segmentation fault" message this time.

Maybe I should make it log all the packets to files, and a way to play them back, so that when it segfaults I have a chance of repeating it.

OK! I found out what triggers it. If you press F5 to clear the screen and *then* a really big packet comes in, it segfaults straight away.

The `memcpy` call in question is:

    payload = sng_malloc(header.caplen);
    memcpy(payload, (void*) buffer + pos + sizeof(hep_chunk_t), header.caplen);

i.e. the exact same size is allocated right before, so seems unlikely to be a buffer overflow. What is `sng_malloc`?

It's just a wrapper around `malloc` that won't let you allocate negative bytes or too many bytes, and zeroes the allocated
space.

Interestingly, `MALLOC_MAX_SIZE` is only set to 102400, which seems low, and is less than double the length
we're trying to copy here. Although the `dest` pointer is non-NULL which suggests `sng_malloc` did allocate it.

But `pkt` and `size` in `capture_eep_receive_v3` are both 0. Is that true or is that a debugger issue?

That is true, it's just used that way.

Ha! The buffer it allocates is only `MAX_CAPTURE_LEN`. And `recvfrom()` is called with `MAX_CAPTURE_LEN` as a size limit, but
it looks like it doesn't properly check the size of everything *within* the HEP. So just sending a short HEP packet with a giant
length field would probably do it.

Omg, so many issues here, where to start?

1. always check the return value of `sng_malloc`
2. check that the offsets within the HEP don't exceed the size of the buffer
3. do this for *all* of the different HEP versions, not just HEP3

Should everything that uses `malloc` be using `sng_malloc`? Or do we not care about some things?

https://github.com/irontec/sngrep/pull/511

`packet.c` uses `malloc` but doesn't check the return values. I don't have the heart to fix that bug across
this entire application though.

I have submitted a bunch of fixes for memory errors. The new thing is that when I send a bunch of corrupted HEP,
the "Idx" column seems to no longer be consecutive? You'll get loads of the same number in a row. How does that
happen?

Ahh, it's just that once Idx goes above 9999 it starts dropping the leading digits. Is that expected? I guess so.
