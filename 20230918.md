## Lever escapement

I modeled some frame plates for the lever escapement prototype:

Annoyingly they're slightly too big to fit both on the printer at once, so I have to do 2 separate prints.

## Balance wheel weighting

The plan is to make a fixture to mount the metal balance wheel on the 4th axis, and then drill holes around the perimeter
to allow M1.6 screws to be added.

We said an M1.6 screw is about 0.06g, currently the balance wheel is 2.6g.
The shaft is mostly a 2mm diameter steel rod, 11mm long, which should weigh maybe 0.3g? And I reckon the supports
across the middle are maybe a third of the mass of the perimeter, so the perimeter is 3/4 of 2.3g = 1.7g.
So to double it we'd need to add 28 M1.6 screws...

So maybe the plan is we use the M1.6 screws to hold some actual weights instead. Regardless, I'm interested to
see how successful I am at putting M1.6 tapped holes around the perimeter.
