## Sovereign Scales

Just thinking some more about how we'd make these.

I'm thinking we surface the "top" of part 1, and machine in the features and profile of the top side,
then flip over and do the same for part 2, making sure the surfacing brings the overall piece to 15mm thick.

But the tricky part is aligning part 1 and part 2 in the Y axis, because once you make the profile for part 1,
the Y reference surface is lost. And if you don't take great care to align them, then it won't sit nicely
flat later on when we come to separate the two pieces.

So to make these parts, I think:

 * load 6mm end mill
 * chop the metal into chunks large enough to make 2 parts (150mm long chunks)
 * set a vice stop that roughly centres the chunks in the vice
 * run "top-side" on every chunk
 * set the Z offset so that the top surface will end up 15mm above the parallels
 * set the Y offset so that the "part 2 top side" will be aligned to "part 1 top side", pick it up by centering on the "other" counterweight
 * run "top-side" on every chunk
 * load drag engraver
 * run "engraving" on both sides of every chunk
 * load 1mm end mill
 * run "slots" on both sides of every chunk
 * set up a fixture for clamping the pieces down on their side in a repeatable place
 * pick up coordinates by pivot hole locations?
 * load 1mm drill
 * run "drill-both-pivot-holes" on every chunk
 * load 6mm end mill
 * run "separate-parts" on every chunk

And the stand needs I think 30mm long chunks to make 2 parts, so in total we use 180mm per 2 parts
of both types, so in 1 metre we get 5 chunks, or 10 parts.

Gcode needed:

 * top-side: form the profile of the entire part, making sure to go deeper around the counterweight, and make pockets for coins
 * engraving: engrave text with drag engraver
 * slots: make slots with 1mm end mill, mind that part of it needs to cut at the very top surface, even though most is lower down
 * drill-both-pivot-holes: use M1 optional stop so that I can check locations?
 * separate-parts: machine a big profile/pocket in the centre of the material, and then gingerly escape out the sides to separate the parts, where the workholding is weak

So this evening if there is time I'll try to start on the gcode, and tomorrow I plan to start on making these.
