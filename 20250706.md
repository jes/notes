## Tractor

I have put together a lay shaft, mounted it in the chassis, moved the motor, and moved the sprocket on the rear axle
because the lay shaft is too short for the motor to be able to drive it if the rear-most sprocket stays at the same
place.

So, all a big hassle, but it is in now and it almost works: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6254

The only issue is the chains are too loose, so I need to work out what is the easiest way to fix that. Either
by adding some sort of tensioning mechanism, or making the lays shaft and motor mountings slotted? Probably
slotted mounts is the easiest way, I just don't want it to weaken the mounting points so that the screws pull
through the plywood. I guess counter that with big washers if it is an issue. So, yeah: slotted mounts is the
way.

And then I can see if it can drive me up the slope.

You can also see the reversing switch. Currently this is obviously too close to the motor, will probably
need to extend the wires. Or, actually, maybe it can just poke up through the floor? And for now you can just
operate it on the floor, and eventually I can make a big shift lever that operates it on the floor.
