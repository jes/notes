## Neural net images

After 239 rounds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXTM76gQs3w

Not really improving very much. Maybe the input images are too high-resolution so training takes too long.
I'm going to split the training data up into 100 different sets that each only have 1% of the data, and choose
a random one each time. Will that help? Not sure. I'll try it anyway.

Also, this is what it looks like if you extrapolate past the trained region: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5381

You can sort of see the face in the middle and just random patterns outside. It might look clearer if the face
were trained a bit better.

The one from jes/Feynman is more interesting: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5382

More evidence that it has learnt the pictures at 2 points in space and has coloured everything else black.

Running with only 1% of the input pixels (even though there are 100 different sets with a different 1% each)
doesn't seem to work very well, it's converged on this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5383

But since I'm saving out the weights periodically, I can start from this point but now use 10% of the data each
time, and then when that plateaus I can use 100%.
