## mk-pivot

The toolpath it generates looks like this, from the end: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4824

I'm not sure if I should be concerned that the "middle" ring of lines there doesn't appear
circular? Need to try it out and see how it looks. Is the trigonometry wrong?

Well I got this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4825

Looks quite good! Better than the previous attempts. The shoulder looks tapered in that microscope
pic, but with the loupe it doesn't look so bad.

The concentricity is not perfect but is better than before.

One issue is that the rotation speed of the A axis is really slow during the cut. I think it is because
the 30-degree angle increment means it maxes out LinuxCNC's look-ahead before it can reach the
programmed speed. Bit annoying, but not the end of the world.

I am going to keep using this method of making pivots for the time being, not least because it is really
the only way I have to make them anywhere near concentric, given my homemade 1mm collet.
