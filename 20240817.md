## CAD model of house

I did a bit more on the CAD model:

This is surprisingly time-consuming. I think I'm almost done with the
ground floor though. Still need to drop the walls where the ceilings slope,
and potentially raise the one wall at the end of the alleyway.

I think the staircase wants to be its own removable part, so there will need to be
some features to locate it and hold it upright. I'm not going to bother making hinged
doors.
