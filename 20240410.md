## Neural net images

The neural net seems to be working OK, although it is taking a long time to train.

It's been running continuously for about 48 hours and this is what it has for jes-to-Feynman:

That's after 674 rounds of training.

Unfortunately I was only saving out the endpoints and a few midpoints, so I can't make a very convincing
animation.

Next step is to modify the program to save out the neural net state, so that I can run it for a few more days,
and then when it is looking good enough I can use the saved out neural net to generate lots of animations.

OK, I have some good first results already: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mwwkP1JDrg

There is a "jump" where it gets to my face, this is at z=0, so perhaps I should make it not pass through 0, say from 1 to 2?
Or make 0 the midpoint and it goes from -1 to 1?
