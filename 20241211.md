## New frame

I've printed some M12 nut holders for the new frame, to hold the balance pivots.

They have a large radius on the outside with an M3 threaded hole in it,
with the idea that I might be able to attach something here that can rotate concentric
with the balance to regulate the spring? Maybe.

## Clock

Since I'm going to be building the new frame
soon, I want to do one last run with
the current frame, and record a video of it.

I'll try and tweak the balance spring first.

Averaged period stayed within about 6.0 milliseconds over a bit over 4 hours,
over a range of about 20 degrees of amplitude.

The amplitude was basically going up the entire time, and the period down the entire time.
Also pressure rising, and temperature mostly dropping.

The non-averaged period/amplitude plot appears to show a few "missing" amplitudes,
but it didn't look to me like the spring was hitting the balance shaft,
so I'm not exactly sure what is happening there. Obviously some discontinuity though.

## TODO

 * make "rate of change of amplitude" work for historical data
 * make the aluminium frame
 * more gearing stages
 * put sensors in housings
 * make BMP390 work
 * 3d-printed coefficients of friction study
 * low-friction pivots study
 * make the balance shaft thinner so that the pallets can be smaller, and/or machine a gap for the tooth to pass through closer to centre
 * try with the new bearings
 * try out a hollow balance shaft with tensioned wire and plastic bearings, instead of conical pivots
 * if you add vanes to the balance wheel, does it lose or gain isochrony with respect to pressure?
