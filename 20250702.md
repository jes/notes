Some good progress here. The axle bearings are mounted, sprocket hub is mounted, chain and motor are mounted:

There is an M6 threaded hole through the axle, that is what the sprocket hub mounts to. So the M6 bolt is taking
all of the load from the motor, but the motor isn't very powerful so I think it's fine. If it ever breaks I can
weld the sprocket hub to the axle.

ChatGPT reckons an M6 bolt through a 20mm steel axle will probably break if I put 135 Nm of torque through it. Also
reckons that if the motor tops out at 8 mph using 350 W, then there is 19 Nm of torque at the axle, so plenty of
safety margin. Unsure how accurate that is though. If it ever breaks I can weld the sprocket hub to the axle.

I then wired up all the electronics:

And it drives! ...backwards.

This may be a major blunder because the motor may be more powerful in one direction than the other, unsure. The plan
is to come up with some sort of reversing switch (just a DPDT switch, I think fine to carry the motor current without
switching a relay, it's about 10 amps, if it fails I can add a relay).

And then I can move on to making the "steering tower" thing, and then think about foot plates, a seat, bodywork,
and a brake. And then we're done?

It very much feels like it doesn't want to steer. This may be an issue. Will find out when I can actually drive it
for the first time.

Next I tried to do the cross-drilling on the steering gearbox input shaft:

I did manage, as you can see, but drilling through the pinion was very difficult. It was hardened. I blunted 2 drills
and broke a third. I managed to do it eventually by annealing it with the blowtorch (though it is still very hard)
and starting the hole with a grinding tool with the Dremel.

So next things are:

 * put the steering box back in
 * find a reversing switch
 * build the steering tower
 * connect up the steering wheel
