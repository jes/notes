## Boggle

I've uploaded it to printables: https://www.printables.com/model/625901-self-aligning-boggle

Now what do I want to put in the demo video?

* open with a demo of shaking it and opening the lid
* what is the problem?
* what is the solution?
* I first tried the thing with gears but it is over-complicated: you already have
  to shake the cubes to shuffle them, why not make the shaking action also align them?
* what is the actual shape of the cube? show the evolution from a plain cube
* there are metal rods inside the cubes to add weight
* the paint job isn't very good, you could do a better job if you have a multi-material printer
* the magnets are counterproductive
* the idea behind the mesh is that it lets you see when all the cubes are in place, but doesn't make it easy to see the letters
* the mesh is made with a modifier cube setting 0 top/bottom layers and 20% gyroid infill
* the mesh is quite springy
* it's available on printables if you want to print it yourself
* thanks for watching, goodbye

I submitted it to "Hasbro Spark", which seems to be designed for kids to submit crayon drawings of their toy ideas.

And I wrote a blog post: https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/self-aligning-boggle.html

So, great success. I'm finished with the Boggle project.
