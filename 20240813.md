## CNC machine

I looked at changing the VFD to vector control mode, but apparently it's already in that mode.

So now I just want to check the configuration for the motor (1.5kW, ~7 amps, 220v?) and if that's OK
then I think I can't get any more torque out of it at low speeds.

It was set to 6.4 amps, but that's probably about right, works out to 1.4kW.

I'm also not going to worry about cable management, I think this is all fine.

So next up is probably shimming the gantry. I want to repeat the measurement so that I know I'm
definitely doing the right thing.

Going up by 84mm moved the indicator by 0.04mm. And after I moved the "cylindrical square", it then
moved by about the same amount but in the opposite direction.

So actually I'm saying the gantry doesn't want shimming. The test cut from yesterday does have some
slight steps in it, but on closer consideration it seems to be the difference between climb milling
and conventional milling. Probably with a lighter cut that would disappear.

So next is putting some holes in the table to glue in some threaded inserts to bolt the aluminium
surface down to.

I have M6 inserts 10mm diameter and 25mm long. 25mm long means they'll need to go all the way through
the table.
