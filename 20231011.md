## Stepper motor clock

I picked up a book "How to make an electric clock" by R. Barnard Way, from a secondhand bookshop in Dawlish.

It uses a normal pendulum for timekeeping, with the pendulum also providing the power to the geartrain (i.e. no separate
power source or escapement). It gives the pendulum a kick with an electromagnet whenever the amplitude gets too low,
I think this is a "Hipp Toggle", e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmx5iy4qwhI

Instead of using an electromagnet to kick a pendulum, and then have the pendulum keeping time, I want to make a clock
where the works are driven by a synchronous motor, so the AC line frequency keeps time.

I think an easy way to do this would be to use a transformer to step 240v down to maybe 12v, and then feed it straight into
one of the coils of a stepper motor. It would have nothing to say which direction it will turn, but any little ratchet should
do, just anything to prevent it from turning backwards should make it start turning forwards.

I'd like to try this out anyway. So on Friday I want to rip a coil out of a transformer, and hook one side up to the mains and
the other side to a stepper motor, and see if it starts turning at a constant speed. If so, I should 3d print the necessary
gears and make a clock. Ideally I could produce this clock in a single day and without buying any components, and it would
keep time as well as the National Grid does.

## CNC machines

I should build a dedicated stand for the CNC router, with some sort of walls to stop chips from escaping, and underneath
it should be like a "funnel" that drops chips into a bin underneath. The table surface should be lower than it is currently,
and easier to access.

Also, obviously the X gantry should be stiffer, the bed should gain a thick metal plate, and maybe there should be an
aquarium air pump air blast.

Also, I should work out where the slop is coming from in the milling machine and fix it.
