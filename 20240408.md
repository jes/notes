## Neural net images

Following on from https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/lenna-neural-net.html

What if instead of **(x,y) => (r,g,b)** we mapped **(x,y,z) => (r,g,b)**, where `z=0` for some base image,
and `z=1` for another, and then we can animate varying the value of `z` to get a cool transition between
the first base image and the second? We won't train on values of `z` other than 0 and 1, but we can
still sample it as a continuous function. What would the intermediate positions look like?

And we can also generate images/animations where the value of `z` is not constant across the entire frame.
For example you could start with every pixel having `z=0`, but sweep a wave across from left to right
where it changes to `z=1` gradually. What would that look like?

This easily generalises to more than 2 images. For example, train on a third image at `z=0.5`.

I've got it running with a picture of me at `z=0` and Richard Feynman at `z=1`, saving out frames for `z=0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1`
after each round of training. I'll let this run for a while and if it looks interesting I'll try to make a
higher-resolution video of transitioning between 2 other pictures.

It's not obvious to me whether the results would be most interesting when the 2 endpoints are very similar, or
when they're very dissimilar.

Also, what happens if you extend beyond the bounds of `[0,1]`? Not only in `z`, but also `x` and `y` for that matter!
