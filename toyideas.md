## Digger

It's like the digger they have at White Row Farm (?), it goes in a sand pit and has 2 levers that the player
can use to operate the bucket, it has a swivelling base that you can paddle around with your feet. Lets you
scoop up sand, move it, drop it, great fun.

## Crane

You'd have a big arm on the ceiling that is controlled from a support in one corner of the room, with controls
to rotate it, extend/retract it, lower the grabber, and operate the grabber. You can use it to pick stuff up
in the room and move it somewhere else.
