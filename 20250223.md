## FreeCAD

hyarion put a comment on https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/19763 suggesting using
a singleton instead of passing it through every function call.

So the new version would be:

 * `Base::ProgressRange` will be a class where the default implementation is total no-op
 * `Base::ProgressRange::getInstance()` will return the currently active instance
 * `Base::ProgressRange::setInstance()` to set it to your custom implementation with gui
 * `Base::ProgressRange::resetInstance()` to turn it back to no-op

And then in the Part module we'll have `OCCTProgressRange` that takes our `Base::ProgressRange` as an argument and passes through function calls, and implements `Message_ProgressRange`.

And the `ComputationDialog` will be in `src/Gui`, and will somehow take a closure
for a function that it will run in the thread.

    Gui::ComputationDialog().run([&]() {
        ...
    });

So I'm thinking I copy the `FreeCAD` directory so that I have a checkout with the
current code in, and then reset my branch to current main and start again?

And actually I think we want to be passing `ProgressScope` rather than `ProgressRange`?

OK, seems to mostly be working, PR here: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/19796

I don't know why progress reporting is broken.

I made it print a backtrace in the `OCCTProgressIndicator` constructor, but I only
see it happen once, which suggests that the problem is not caused by repeatedly
creating new `Message_ProgressRange`s.

I also see it basically stay on 0% forever, occasionally go up to 1% or 2%, then back
down to 0%. Next plan is printing calls to `Show()`.

Oh, I think I see the problem. `GetPortion()` tells you what percentage of the indicator
is covered by the scope - not what percentage of the indicator is filled!

To get the percentage I need to get `Value() / MaxValue()` I think.

Yeah that was
the problem, but `Value() / MaxValue()` makes it keep flicking between 0% and 100%.
I need `GetPosition()` on the `Message_ProgressIndicator`, and now it is working well.

We have the behaviour back where it can get stuck at 9% on a PolarPattern and not allow
aborting. I feel like this went away before, I guess I put `UserBreak()` checks in
more places?

I'm checking out the old `occt-userbreak-2` branch, resetting to before my massive
unfinished change, and I'll see if it still gets stuck at 9%. Yes, it was still
getting stuck at 9%. Never mind then, no regression. Why did I have trouble reproducing
this yesterday then?

Also need to include `<windows.h>` in `ComputationDialog.cpp` on Windows to make
sure `TerminateThread` can work. Anything else? ChatGPT says I should call
`CloseHandle(threadHandle)` just after terminating it.

Now re-throws exceptions & progress percentage is fixed, so remaining is:

 * use ComputationDialog in more places
 * gate "force abort" behind a config parameter, and default to not enabled, since it nearly always segfaults (related is see if we can make it actually work)
