## Cyclecar

So in the early 20th century there was a type of car called a [Cyclecar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclecar).
They were small and simple cars made out of motorbike parts.

So obviously the plan is to build a modern-day cyclecar!

People build [Cyclekarts](https://www.cyclekartsgb.com/members-cyclekarts) which are styled after cyclecars but use modern
GX200 engines. They tend to include lots of non-functional parts for aesthetic reasons, like fake exhaust pipes etc., which I don't really support.
I don't want to make an imitation of a cyclecar, I want to make a real one.

There is [a road-legal cyclekart](https://www.cyclekartsgb.com/geoffs-hornet) which gives a good guide to the standard
you need to aim for and it looks eminently achievable.

I think this looks like more joy and less expense than buying a classic car.

But I don't want a GX200 with a CVT, I want something more like a pit bike engine.

I have put some notes in [MSVA](msva.md) about the requirements.

I think mostly:

 * keep it below 20hp so you fit in "heavy quadricycle" regulation instead of "car"
 * keep it below 250kg so you don't need to mess about with seatbelts
 * brakes on all wheels
 * all the lights

If you make it a three-wheeler then you don't have the horsepower limit, but I think 20hp for a 250kg vehicle is plenty anyway.

I would be looking at something like a ZS190 pit bike engine. And I would want a bench seat that can accommodate 2 at a push, but absolutely no
wider than necessary.

Undecided as to whether I want a diff or not. Potentially more fun if you don't have a diff and just make sure the weight distribution is far enough
forwards that you can comfortably steer. So put the engine right at the front.

A "Frazer-Nash" is an example of a historical cyclecar with a solid rear axle chain-driven, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dvbUYAaamw - it looks like the rear track is slightly narrower
than the front track, probably wise. Looks good fun. I would want something smaller and lighter and slower but otherwise along these lines.
