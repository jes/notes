## Duplex escapement

Latest CAD in `duplex-escapement2.FCStd`: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5249

 * escape wheel teeth: **8**
 * unlocking angle: **34 degrees** of roller
 * impulse angle: **46 degrees** of roller
 * unlocking: **11 degrees** of escape wheel
 * impulse drop: **2.5 degrees** of escape wheel
 * impulsing: **28.5 degrees** of escape wheel
 * lock drop: **3 degrees** of escape wheel

And I didn't notice any geometrical issues.

So we're spending `28.5 / 45 = ~63%` of escape wheel motion on
impulse, and the rest on unlocking and dropping. Not clear
whether that is good or bad or indifferent.

I like that the unlocking angle is small (34 degrees vs about 70
degrees in Daniels) without a comparable reduction in impulse
angle.

This version has the roller setup so that it can be made as a
separate component and fitted to a 1mm shaft. But maybe we
could reduce the shaft to 0.5mm where the roller table
needs to fit on, and then we can make the roller smaller to
reduce friction.

I think Daniels said that a typical escape wheel has locking
diameter 12.5x as big as the roller. In my model it is only
about 7x as big.

Looking in `duplex-escapement2-smallroller.FCStd`.

## Car

The plan is to replace the fuel pump and clean out the tank today.
