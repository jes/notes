## Line of sight map

The idea is that it would be an OpenStreetMap view or whatever,
except you pick some vantage point on the map, and then anything that
is obscured by terrain has hatch marks or lines or whatever drawn over it.

So you can tell from any particular spot what you ought to be able to see.

And maybe we let you specify a viewing altitude as well, in case you're not
at ground level.

I think for every point on a 10px by 10px grid on the screen, draw an
imaginary line from the vantage point to that point. Cast a ray along
that imaginary line. If it hits the ground then draw a solid line from the
point where it first hits the ground to the point we're measuring to.

That way everything that is obscured by terrain will have solid lines drawn
over it.

So I think the first step is a map viewer that gives me the capability to
draw lines on top of it. Is MapLibreGL the best tool? I can put a
see-through canvas over the top if necessary, just need to be able to convert
the coordinate systems.

Apparently MapLibreGL has `map.project(lngLat)` and `map.unproject(xy)` to
convert between coordinates.

And we have the option of a GeoJSON "layer" to add the lines. Probably best to
go with that and only do the transparent canvas thing if GeoJSON proves
unpleasant.

I'm trying to download a new version of Cursor but the internet here is too
awful. Need to get Starlink. It has been over half an hour and still hasn't
downloaded 180 MB.

Where do I get terrain data from?

Apparently https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/ can give you elevation
data. Seems more like a 3d globe viewer though, not necessarily what I want.

I'll just try and get a basic MapLibreGL map up and then figure out elevation
after.

OK I have a basic map, with map and satellite view, and I can click to set
the vantage point.

I had it draw lines to points on a 10px-spacing grid, but actually that is
wrong, we just want radial lines at a consistent *angle* spacing.

Oh no, actually that's still not right. We only want to draw lines on the
*parts* of the terrain that are invisible. There might be a valley that we
can't see into but then we can see the mountains again the other side of it.
So we may need several line segments per direction.

OK, great, it is getting terrain data from AWS. Now to do the ray casting.

This is really cool, this is actually working now. One issue is that to get
a good map you need to sample a *lot* of points and it is actually quite slow.

I wonder if I can get it to iteratively add more points over the course of 10
seconds or so, so you get some straight away, and it remains interactive, but
the density fills in over time.

Great, working: https://incoherency.co.uk/line-of-sight-map/
