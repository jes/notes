## Clock

Just for some amusement I ran the clock this evening. The only change
since last time is I moved the remontoire weight marginally closer to the gear, i.e.
slightly less drive torque on the escape wheel.

I definitely want to be able to run this for longer so that I can spot environmental
effects.

I am thinking that the big drawback of the Korfhage remontoire is that you need that extra
shaft that spins faster than the escape wheel. I can easily imagine that my clock will
be right at the very limit of how much torque it can squeeze out of the long geartrain,
so having to spin another shaft 8x as fast just to control the remontoire is not ideal.

I could experiment with the endless-chain type.

Also, I think putting the drive weight on a pulley is an obvious win. You basically get an
extra factor of 2 in runtime (equivalently, you take a factor of 2 off your train ratio)
for free. Even if your pulley is really sticky, what's it going to do? Not fall downhill?
You basically don't lose any torque even if the pulley is really bad, which is not something
that can be said for the train.

As long as the pulley is not *keyed* to the rope then it can always just fall down the
rope even if it's not rolling.

With a longer string and a pulley on the weight, and a longer winding drum to take
advantage of it, I think the current prototype would easily run for 3 or 4 hours on
twice the drive weight.

Would more stages of pulleys also help?

## TODO

 * more gearing stages
 * design the frame
 * store all datalogging persistently, and allow viewing static data from some specified time window
 * put sensors in housings, make raspberry pi case
 * 3d-printed coefficients of friction study
 * low-friction pivots study
 * put a fly on the remontoire
 * put a pulley on the falling weight
 * longer string, longer winding drum
