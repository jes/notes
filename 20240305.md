## Machine design

I've extended the Y ballscrew to accommodate the ballnut holder, and moved the motor back. The good news is the
motor now fits the machine without having to cut anything out of the baseplate. The bad news is it may not fit
in the tub:

There does appear to be space if I push everything forwards but I'm not sure how accurate the tub dimensions are,
need to check.

The X ballscrew didn't need extending as it was already more than long enough.

 * X ballscrew: **400mm** threaded
 * Y ballscrew: **300mm** threaded
 * Z ballscrew: **200mm** threaded

I measured the width of the tub again and the red length here shows the measured space available: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5352

So I think the CAD model is actually pretty close, and I think there is just enough room to fit the machine inside the tub.
And I've taken 10mm off the front of the baseplate as that part served no purpose. So I think there's definitely space now.

I'll start on cut-outs for clearance once the parts have arrived
and I can actually measure them.
