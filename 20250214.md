## Dots in space

I want to try automatically rolling the craft so that the player's left/right access is parallel to the ground. Then I can ditch the roll inputs.

It is working, but it is kind of annoying. Maybe better than having either uncontrolled
or manually-controlled roll. Might be nice to show an artificial horizon.
