Plan:

* car MOT
* finish the Douzieme gauge
* tidy the garage and office
* maybe start on CAD of the next metal escapement

It's too wet to cut the grass. I've taken the car to the MOT. On to the Douzieme gauge...

## Making the scale

I followed the instructions I wrote yesterday. Here's after the first pass of engraving (~10 mins):

The writing is maybe too small.

And after sanding the burrs off:

I'm going to run a second pass to make it deeper, and then experiment with trying to put sharpie or
paint in the grooves.
