## Climbing frame

Plan:

 * go and pick up supplies
 * mark for floor and dig post holes
 * gravel in bottom of post holes
 * posts in holes, and posts bolted together to ensure correct spacing, level, etc.
 * concrete in post holes
 * topsoil or sand or something to level out the ground
 * weed membrane down

Supplies are:

 * 1 bag of cement
 * 3 bags of sharp sand for mixing concrete
 * 3 bags of gravel for bottom of holes
 * 3 bags topsoil or sand

I think 3 bags of gravel for the bottoms of the holes was a bit optimistic! I can't be bothered doing
any more digging than absolutely necessary, so there is not going to be a lot of gravel at the bottom.
Oh well.

I've stopped for lunch now, plan to do some more digging after.

I didn't even use half a bag of gravel, lol.

Side pieces assembled: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6304

These are just about light enough to lift up and carry. The plan is to lift one of these
into place and attach the horizontal braces to it, then lift the other one into place
and attach the horizontal braces to that, and then it should stand up on its own.

Then we shift it around until it looks square and level, and then pour concrete into the
holes.

It is going to rain very soon so we've stopped for now, hopefully only 90 mins of rain though,
probably we can resume about 4pm.

Hopefully the arrangement of these parts becomes clear on its own once the main structure is up.
