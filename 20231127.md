## Stepper motor clock

I'm a bit confused about what sort of magnets I should be using. My notes say the CAD is intended for 8mm by 2mm magnets,
but the CAD has a hole that is 6.2mm in diameter.

It wants magnets that are **6mm by 2mm**, and they are not quite a press fit so they want a drop of superglue.

Next up is preparing the frame pieces.

I think my ethernet cable is 10m and really wants to be 12m. For now I've strung it up diagonally, but I've ordered
a female-to-female plug so that I can extend it with a 2m cable and then pin it up properly.

I've put an MDF top on the computer desk: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5058
