## Moon phase

This page was on HN today: https://genuineideas.com/ArticlesIndex/phase.html

Lots of discussion of historical methods of moon phase display. They mainly take beef
with the fact that the "circle occluded by circle" method always has a crescent across the
moon at half-moon, when in reality it should show a straight line, and then they present
various methods of fixing it. They come up with a version based on sliding segments that
could maybe work in a wristwatch. For my clock I think a rotating sphere would be fine,
black on one side and white on the other. That's if I decided to add a moon phase display,
of course.

More important to get it running for a year at all first.

## Bearings

My new 3mm micro bearings have arrived, I'll try them out. First impression is they look
much higher quality. Also a lot less play in them, tighter fit on the shaft, no wobble
in the races, good.

Doesn't spin super freely, I need to soak them in IPA to thin the oil I think.

After only a few minutes' soaking, I gave it another go. Much better already.
I span the escape wheel in the old bearings and it span for 55 seconds before stopping,
in the new ones 52 seconds.

I tried again and got 43 seconds in the new bearings and 35 seconds on the old ones. I think
I'd need a more repeatable way of starting it at a constant speed to decide which is better.
But I think the new bearings aren't obviously better or worse than the old ones, maybe a
bit more soaking in the alcohol will do it. (But then maybe a bit more soaking in alcohol
would have fixed up the old ones as well?).

I could really do with some sort of pivot friction testing rig.
