I've been working on the pin pallet escapement simulator. It partly works.
https://github.com/jes/pin-pallet-escapement

Next steps:

* fix the angle of the impulse face on the escape wheel teeth (it is translated away from radial after having the angle set relative to radial)

* in `update()`, don't run the update if nothing changed

* fix mouse rotation of the pallets (seems maybe off by 90 degrees?)

* fix the location of the triangle holding the pallets together

* make the triangle non-colliding

* improve the mouse controls so that unlocking the pallets works more smoothly
