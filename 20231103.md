## Stepper motor clock

I went out and sprayed another coat of varnish: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4926

Looks pretty good, I probably won't do another after this. Also I noticed that in CAD
the intention was to have the "large" part of the base at the *back*, so that the electrical
stuff has more room, instead of at the front where it doesn't serve much of a purpose. Oops,
never mind.

So now I need to design the cover for the electrics.

I've gone for this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4927

I can't be bothered cutting out plastic pieces for the windows, so it's all made solid.

My clamp meter has arrived, so let's try and work out how much power this motor is using...

Around the low-voltage side it is reading **213 mA**, which I recall is at about 13 volts, = **2.7 W**.
On the 240v side it is reading **308 mA**, which at 240v is **74 W**.

But why is the primary drawing more current than the load on the secondary, when the seconday is
a lower voltage? Is this transformer really only 4% efficient?

I don't think that can be right, else the transformer would be dissipating 70 watts and would get
much hotter than the motor.

The clamp meter seems to give very different readings based on the angle at which I hold it, not very good.

The highest I measured for the secondary was 860mA, and the lowest for the primary was 80mA, which works
out to about 10 watts at the motor or 19 watts at the primary. Still seems wrong. I think the issue is that
the wires are too close to the transformer, and the field from the transformer is interfering with the
clamp meter.
