## Steering wheel

I've made the steering wheel:

Great success, pleased with this. Didn't really have any mishaps, just designed it in CAD, cut it out with the CNC machine, bent it, bolted it together. Brilliant.

The bolts holding it together are just threaded into the plastic and they are quite short threads, and have partially stripped. I am thinking I'll
reprint the plastic parts in black, and use heat-set inserts instead of threading into the plastic. This is fine for now though.
