Proceeding with the regex library, I think the next step is to make it work on my regex-based
day 2 solution, which I think means it needs to stop leaking so much memory.

Sorted that, but the regex for counting the numbers had to be `\\s*[,;]?\\s*(\\d+) (red|green|blue)`
because regexes are always anchored at the start. So let's address that next. Firstly, unanchored
regexes need to match anywhere (an implict `.*` at the start, but without adjusting `recap(0)`), but
also I want to support optional anchoring.
