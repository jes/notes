## Lever escapement

I modeled some frame plates for the lever escapement prototype:

Annoyingly they're slightly too big to fit both on the printer at once, so I have to do 2 separate prints.

## Balance wheel weighting

The plan is to make a fixture to mount the metal balance wheel on the 4th axis, and then drill holes around the perimeter
to allow M1.6 screws to be added.

We said an M1.6 screw is about 0.06g, currently the balance wheel is 2.6g.
The shaft is mostly a 2mm diameter steel rod, 11mm long, which should weigh maybe 0.3g? And I reckon the supports
across the middle are maybe a third of the mass of the perimeter, so the perimeter is 3/4 of 2.3g = 1.7g.
So to double it we'd need to add 28 M1.6 screws...

So maybe the plan is we use the M1.6 screws to hold some actual weights instead. Regardless, I'm interested to
see how successful I am at putting M1.6 tapped holes around the perimeter.

Update: instead of making a fixture I can just use the superglue arbor! Great success.

I think I want some ~25mm aluminium rod though, I don't have any material suitable for making a fixture for this.
I've ordered a 60cm length.

It increased from 2.6g to 3.3g (+27%), with almost all of the mass at the perimeter,
so the moment of inertia should be increased by more than 27%. Still not a lot though. I can try using the M1.6 screws
to hold down M3 nuts to add more weight.
