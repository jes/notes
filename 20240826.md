Now that the table is surfaced I can sweep an indicator across to work out how perpendicular
the spindle axis is to the table surface.

That won't tell me anything about how accurately the Z axis moves parallel to the spindle axis,
but it's worth looking at anyway.

At a radius of about 19mm the depth only varies by about 0.01mm, and even then it varies by about
that much depending on whether I'm touching the spindle. So actually I think the tram is very good.
So why is the table surface not flatter?

Dragging the indicator across the surface in the Y axis shows the needle bouncing by about 0.01mm, so I think
0.01mm is just the roughness. But why is there so much roughness if the spindle is perpendicular to the table?

Maybe a 19mm radius isn't enough to show it? But it should be, if we've got 0.01mm roughness from a 1.5mm stepover?

Forget it for now. Move on to drilling holes.

I'm going to first try to drill them with a 4mm drill, then once that is done open them up with 5mm, then
probably take the table off and tap them on the bench.

For a 32mm grid we have 288mm between the outer holes on the X axis (12mm short of full length, so first one is at X=6),
and 192mm on the Y axis (8mm short of full length, so first one is at Y=4).

The "lathe speeds" chart suggests 2500 to 10000 rpm for drilling aluminium with a 4mm HSS drill. Let's start at 6000.

It's chip-welding badly with 100 mm/min feed. If we feed faster? 200 mm/min seemed a bit better. Try 300.

Still chip-welding. Looking online suggests reducing the speed to reduce the temperature. So let's try 4000 rpm and 200 mm/min.

Seems better, we're getting further. Just doesn't quite have enough torque. I'll try reducing the feed rate to 150 mm/min.

Now down to 94% feed (140 mm/min) and 95Hz (5700 rpm). I'm increasing the speed on the VFD because it keeps stalling.

Now open them up with 5mm. Starting out with the same settings as I finished the 4mm holes. I expect less trouble because there
is less material to remove.

Ugh, it's bird's-nesting really badly. It's drilling nicely, just won't break the chip.

The answer is to feed a lot harder. I'm now at 4900 rpm and 256 mm/min and it is just about breaking.

I did probably half the holes at these settings. It looked like this at the end:

But it was roughly shedding bird's-nesting at the same rate as it was acquiring it. And it wasn't quite stalling at
the bottoms of the holes. Anyway, done now, great success. Time for tapping.

Tapping is very time-consuming, and now the cordless drill battery is flat so I have to wait. Making progress though.
I've done all 70 holes with the smallest tap, and about 24 with the medium-sized tap.
