It will be several rounds of this, and eventually hopefully will have a nice smooth bonnet.

Shaping the curve is quite tricky. It's OK at the sides because you have the side pieces for reference,
but in the middle is hard. I'm going to 3d print a matching curve so that I can use it as a reference
for sanding, and next time can use it to spread bodyfiller.
