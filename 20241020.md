## CNC machine

I checked all of the axes for any signs of looseness that could be causing the chattering and didn't find anything wrong.

I tightened up the Y axis ballscrew bearing slightly, but it didn't feel loose, shouldn't make any difference.

My best guess is that the spindle bearings are worn, but again I can't feel anything wrong there. I did not put an indicator
on it to see how worn it is.

## 3d printer

The plan with the 3d printer is to try a print at 50% speed and if it still has the underextrusion, just buy a Bambu X1 Carbon.
If printing slowly solves it, then just get used to printing slowly.

It hasn't helped. One more thing is to try different filament.

That hasn't helped. Next thing is take the extruder apart and clean it all and put back together.

There was one "tooth" in the extruder gear that was packed in with crusty bits of filament, I managed to clean it out with a needle.
The rest looked OK. Could that be the cause?

Actually looks like it might have been!

## CAD model of house

I've put tiles on the kitchen roof, and connected up the chimney holes.

See chimney path here: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5621

Obviously the exact locations and angles of the shifts are speculative, but we can infer that they're pretty much
like that, otherwise there wouldn't be enough room for it to join up. In particular the chimney bit of wall that it
travels through on the first floor is smaller than the other two, so it probably is pretty much straight in that
section.

I'm not going to bother putting holes in the other chimneys since there are no fireplaces for them to come out of.

So then we could do some boxing around pipes, but I think maybe skip that as well, doesn't really matter.

And some implied brick texture? Let's give it a go, and if it looks bad just delete it. And then we're done.

I tried adding some bricks: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5622

But I actually think they don't look good. I'm going to delete them, and say we're finished.

I've started the ground floor printing!
