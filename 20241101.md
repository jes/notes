## Filament inventory

For spools that are already partially used (or sample spools, e.g. the ones that
came with the Bambu printer) I've estimated the remaining weight by a combination of
visual comparison and memory of how much I've printed.

### PLA

 * 3dfilaprint PLA bronze-filled: 150g (quite old)
 * Bambu PLA Basic Green: 200g (unopened sample spool)
 * Bambu PLA Basic White: ~200g
 * Biqu PLA Matte Blue: ~900g
 * eSun PLA+ Black: ~200g (AMS 1)
 * eSun PLA+ White: ~200g (AMS 3)
 * Overture PLA Matte Light Brown: 1kg (unopened)

### PETG

 * 3dfilaprint CARBON-P Natural: ~400g (quite old; marked "blocks nozzle"; I remember this being quite brittle, but could work better in a heated chamber, maybe try it with a 0.6mm nozzle)

### PC

 * Prusa PC Blend Natural White: ~100g
 * Polymaker PC-MAX Black: ~500g (quite old; I remember this being very hard to print and having poor layer adhesion, but again could work better in a heated chamber)

### TPU

 * Bambu TPU 95A HF White: 1kg (unopened)
 * "E-DA" TPU 97A Black: ~900g

### Nylon

 * 3DXTech CarbonX Nylon: ~200g (quite old)
 * Bambu PAHT-CF: ~400g (AMS 4)

### Support

 * Bambu Support for PLA: ~180g (AMS 3)
 * Bambu Support for PLA/PETG: 500g (unopened)

## Vice stop

I'm printing the vice stop in PAHT-CF. I don't actually like the design, but it might be better than
nothing.

Not super satisfactory: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5665

It is not a very repeatable stop because it is too flexible. I think most of the flex comes
from the bolt at the bottom not being as tight as it could be, and due to the design it is very
difficult to get an allen key on it once it is installed because the vice is in the way.

Oh well. Might be better than nothing.

Also I think the PAHT-CF needs drying.

## 3d printing

I don't actually have any straightforward PETG at the moment, could be worth getting some.

And I've never tried printing with any of:

 * ABS
 * ASA
 * the lightweight/aero foaming stuff
 * glass fibre reinforcement

Bambu don't sell any non-reinforced nylon material.

## TPU in AMS

I'd like to try printing with the TPU but it says it is not compatible with the AMS,
which makes it much more annoying. It is tempting to try with the AMS anyway but I don't want to
have to untangle it all if it gets stuck.

It would be really cool to be able to do multi-material prints with TPU and some rigid material,
so that you can add flexible parts.

Apparently this is what happens if you try to print TPU with the AMS:

From https://forum.bambulab.com/t/printing-tpu-with-ams/5005/9

The Bambu wiki https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/knowledge-sharing/tpu-printing-guide says that
the AMS is compatible with "77D, 55D, or higher hardness TPU".

This YouTube video is linked in the thread: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-YEx0Aaloc - this is no use because (according to the video) it removes compatibility with non-TPU filaments, so you still can't print mixed-material.

Apparently even if you select "Skip AMS Blacklist Check" in Bambu Studio, the AMS still
refuses to print TPU. You just need to tell it that it's PLA or something, but keep the TPU
settings.

This model claims to enable TPU printing from AMS: https://makerworld.com/en/models/492956#profileId-417985

There's a comment saying that flexible material for AMS is launching on 12th of November.

Maybe the best thing to do is just buy harder TPU.

Meh, I'm just going to put some TPU in the AMS and see what happens.

I chose the "E-DA" stuff that I've had for ages, supposedly 97A. It is probably very moist
and wants drying out. I've configured it in Bambu Studio as "Generic TPU for AMS", will it print?

I'm printing with the chamber open, and there is still some glue stick residue on the bed.

First try will be a single-material gingerbread man cutter.

Well it seems to have fed the filament all the way to the hot end, that's promising.

Seems to have purged successfully. Indeed looked quite bubbly. I'm leaving the door open.

The calibration lines haven't printed very well. Underextruded and poor bed ahesion. Although
the actual print looks like it might be working?

This is **"Generic TPU for AMS" default settings, door open, nozzle at 230 deg. C, bed at
35 deg. C**. And I have glue stick on the build plate but I don't expect that is necessary.

First layer has gone down pretty well, this is good.

Second layer is going way too fast! I'd be surprised if this works.

Oh my word, it actually looks like it is working?

One issue with a fully-enclosed printer is it's really hard to see the print while it's going.

I remember this material was quite foamy last time I used it, years ago. Maybe the issue
was just that I was printing it too hot and it actually works fine at 230 deg. C?

I'm actually really impressed with this, it is a way better print than I ever got from this
material before.

Next up will be a test with mixed-material, which will provide much more opportunity for it to
go wrong because it will need to do lots of loading/unloading instead of just once.
