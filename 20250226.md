## Car ramp toy

Assembled on a wooden frame:

I tried it out with an ordinary car toy, and it works but it slides on its roof
on half of it, as you'd expect. So I need to make an invertible toy car.

I used "pause at layer" to put an M10 nut inside it, and a colour change at the
middle layer to make it 2 colours, so when it flips over to change direction
it will "change colour".

Now to try to fit the wheels...

The first thing I tried was 1mm rods, loose in both the body and the wheel, and
mushroomed over at the end. I made them slightly too loose in the wheel so it was
wobbly. I mushroomed over the end by squeezing tightly in the vice. The first end
with the axle loose, the second end once it's in the car, which means you need
extra length. It worked and was easy but left sharp ends.

So the next thing was to go up to 1.5mm rods, make them loose in the body and press-fit
in the wheels. That works, doesn't roll as easily but less wobbly and no sharp
ends.

It doesn't roll down very well, gets derailed most of the time. In a way that makes it
more fun because you can keep trying and hope to get a clean run.

I've machined an aluminium rod down to 12mm, and machined a flat on it, and it
fits in the parts it needs to fit in, great success.

I didn't do a great job of turning the 12mm diameter, it has lots of steps and
discontinuities in it. It'll do though.

I couldn't turn it in one go because the lathe turns a taper, so I did it in lots
of sections.

Oh my god I'm an idiot.

I cut the shaft to about 250mm long, because I remembered that the frame pieces
are 244mm long. But it needs to be 50mm on top of that because it needs to go into
the bearings that are further apart than the frame rails.

So annoying, I would have been better off just not cutting it at all, it was 300mm
when I started.

Probably the easiest fix is to make different bearing blocks that stick inwards a bit.

Annoying.
