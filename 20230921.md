## Bangle.js commute timer

The ETA calculation works really well, but the delta time is still
much bigger than it should be. Seems maybe 100x to 1000x too big?
Need to investigate.

## Lever escapement

I should try increasing the angle of the escape wheel teeth (laying
them back further) so that they transfer impulse to the pallets more
easily. Might make it run with less weight.

## Case

I had the idea that maybe the bottom of the case can be fixed to
the outer barrel, so it will all rotate against your wrist when
winding. Then the face essentially becomes the "frame" that the
movement is locked to (via the winding ratchet). Or, to put it
another way, there is a central frame, with the movement below and
the face above. And we can
potentially make it watertight by putting an O-ring on the join
between the outer barrel and the frame.
