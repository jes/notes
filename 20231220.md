## Pocket watch

I took the pocket watch apart as far as I could conveniently go (didn't take the balance spring off, didn't undo
anything that was riveted).

I cleaned everything in alcohol and put it back together with oil on the pivots.

It still doesn't run, not sure what the problem is. I can't tell whether the balance has conical pivots, or
if the pivots are actually broken off.

This website calls them "cone pivots": https://www.weclarkwatchrepairs.co.uk/blog/types-of-pivot/

And there is indeed a screw I can adjust to set the end shake. So maybe the problem is that the cups are too worn?

Maybe I should use cone pivots in my watch.
