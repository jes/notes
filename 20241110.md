## Sovereign Scales

One more go at sheet metal Sovereign Scales today. Things to remember were:

 * watch out for travel moves that are too low, make sure they are Z10 or higher
 * flip the aluminium sheet over
 * drill the pivot hole in the beam at 1.1mm
 * run the 6mm end mill at 6750 rpm, 112.5 Hz
