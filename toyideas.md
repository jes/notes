# Toy ideas

## Digger

It's like the digger they have at White Row Farm (?), it goes in a sand pit and has 2 levers that the player
can use to operate the bucket, it has a swivelling base that you can paddle around with your feet. Lets you
scoop up sand, move it, drop it, great fun.

## Crane

You'd have a big arm on the ceiling that is controlled from a support in one corner of the room, with controls
to rotate it, extend/retract it, lower the grabber, and operate the grabber. You can use it to pick stuff up
in the room and move it somewhere else.

## Window clock kit

It's a bunch of clock parts (shafts, gears, pendulum, hands, etc.) but the shafts are all on suction cups
so that they can be stuck to a window, and you lay out your mechanism by sticking shafts to the window
and putting all the parts on the shafts.

## Oscillating roundabout

A swing is a ride-on pendulum. An oscillating roundabout is a ride-on *balance wheel*.

The main difference is that the period of the balance wheel depends on the moment of inertia, which means it will
be faster for smaller kids. Also that rogue kids can put a lot more energy into a balance wheel than they can into
a pendulum, because with a swing they are limited by how high they can reach, but with an oscillating roundabout
they are only limited by how much torque they can apply. So it may be a dangerous toy.
