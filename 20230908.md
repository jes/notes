## Escapement

First thing, I modelled the weird 3-arm escapement: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4614

And waiting for it to print. That's a fun distraction but not necessarily relevant to the watch project.

I think next things to look at on the watch are:

 * make some higher-quality gears and shafts at final scale
 * cut a pinion on to a shaft (how?)
 * wind up a scrap mainspring and see how its torque varies
 * see if there is any geometric modification to the (good, not 3-arm) escapement prototype that can make its tick rate more constant under varying torque
