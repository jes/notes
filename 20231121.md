## Stepper motor clock

First job: wire up a Digi-Key stepper motor, capacitor, and transformer, and check that they work as intended.

Yep! Looks good. https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5033

And this is with the 12v motor running on 6.3v. I'm going to leave it running for a bit and see if anything gets warm. Started
at about 9.20am.

I also want to time 10 revolutions or something and see if it looks believably like it takes 10.24 seconds/rev. I'm
going to risk the DuckDuckGo stopwatch again.

Lol, nowhere near. This is about 4x faster, probably 2.56 secs/rev. Frustrating, I expected the ratio to be the same. I timed
1m37.31s for 38 revolutions = 2.5607 seconds/rev. I think running faster might make it look cooler though, just
needs another factor of 4 on the geartrain.

These are the markings on the Digi-Key motors: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5034

So I'm trying to work out a train that would work for this. A first point of reference is obviously 1:40 8:45 8:50, which
is the same as the train on my clock, but with 40 teeth on the Geneva drive. The Geneva drive teeth are quite big, so
I'd oibvously like to reduce that a bit and shift some of the extra onto the other gears.

So we could look at 1:30 6:45 8:50.

I wrote a perl script to solve it (in `~/gear-ratios/find3`) and the best it came up with was 1:25 6:45 6:45. So let's
go with that, and update the CAD to suit. I'll copy it to a new project so I still have the old one in case I need it.

Damn, a 5mm shaft won't fit through the middle of a 6-tooth pinion at module 1.5.

I just read in https://wiki.freecad.org/PartDesign_InvoluteGear that:

> There is currently no undercut in the generated gear profile. That means gears with a low number of teeth can interfere with the teeth of the mating gear. The lower limit depends on the DataPressure Angle and is around 17 teeth for 20° and 32 for 14.5°. Most practical applications tolerate a missing undercut for gears a little smaller than this theoretical limit though.

So that may explain why I have trouble with getting the gears to mesh properly.

One way to get around the problem with the shaft being too big would be to make 3d-printed "lantern pinions", i.e. put a big
ring at the end to hold the teeth together even though they are separated in the middle.

I'll go with that for now, but maybe I will want to make my own tooth profiles, to add some clearance for backlash.
I definitely want to do that on the Scotch Yoke clock, but maybe best just to get this one done and out of the way.

 * check if I have 6 of the required magnets
 * check if I have 2 of the required washers

Damn, the Geneva wheel interferes with the shaft of the second wheel: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5037

It just doesn't end! Maybe I can allow this, if I slide the Geneva wheel forwards and the second wheel back.

12.05pm: the stepper motor is barely even detectable warm, I'm satisfied that it stays cool enough, switching it off.

## Garage

We've took all the stored (hoarded?) wood out of the corner, and put the large kitchen drawers in the corner, to form
a desk combined with the small kitchen drawers. Top to be made out of MDF when it arrives.

I think I want materials storage to the left of the lathe, but there are lots of different types of material to store
and I want a sensible solution.

 * Very large sheets, plywood etc.: down the side of the motorbike, as now
 * Very long bar/pipe: horizontally against the wall, as now, but with more brackets
 * Short-ish bar/pipe: make a "pyramid" of plastic pipes standing vertically and put the bars in the appropriate pipes?
 * Small sheets: ???

## Garage roof

I've applied the "Everbuild Everflex Roof and Gutter Sealant" in between the slabs on the front of the garage roof:

It was very difficult to apply, has given me arm pump. Hopefully it cures the leak though.
