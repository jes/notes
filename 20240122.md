## G-code sender

I was wrong about the `Pn:` state being indeterminate when it isn't present. Apparently `Pn:` appears
in *every* Grbl status report if any pin is activated. I misunderstood the documentation and took it
to be sent only periodically or on state changes (like with `Ov:` etc.).

I should hook up a jumper wire to the Arduino I'm testing with and just verify that, but that's good news.

Apparently the probe pin is A5. Let's give it a go. Should be normally-open and connected to ground
on contact.

Yep, golden. We get `Pn:P` on every status report as long as the probe pin is connected to ground.
