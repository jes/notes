## Stepper motor clock

I asked [on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/electrical/comments/17qtro6/whats_the_simplest_way_to_get_a_90degree_phase/)
about how to get a 90-degree phase shift in AC to drive my stepper motor. One person told me you need to use
a microcontroller, which means they totally missed the point. But two people told me you can use just a capacitor
to shift the phase. Is that right??

I tried it out in the [Falstad circuit simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/):

The resistor represents the load, and you can see the two voltage plots at the bottom.
By playing around with the capacitance value I *was* able to shift the phase, but it seems
like the more the phase shifts, the lower the amplitude gets.

However in my application I think this is completely fine! So next things to try are:

 * switch back to the 6v transformer
 * power the other coil of the motor via a capacitor

I wonder if the centres of the coils being tied together will be a help or a hindrance?
Maybe need to try just driving "half" of each coil, and letting the common wire be common.
