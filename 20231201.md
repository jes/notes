## Stepper motor clocks

Well they still seem pretty much in sync, except the bamboo clock has lost maybe one revolution of the
stepper motor. They both stall pretty easily if pressed with a finger, I should try to acquire maybe
33uF capacitors just to see if that helps.

I got back from work and they were both a few minutes behind the real time, but both by the same amount, which
makes me think they have both kept good time?

I'm not sure how accurately they were synced to the real time in the first place as I didn't have dials. I've
synced them both to pretty much the right time, so if I notice them a few minutes behind again then I'll know
they're losing time.

## Advent of Code

First day of Advent of Code!

Damn, could have really done with regexes for part 2, lol. Oh well.
