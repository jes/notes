## Cyclecar

So in the early 20th century there was a type of car called a [Cyclecar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclecar).
They were small and simple cars made out of motorbike parts.

So obviously the plan is to build a modern-day cyclecar!

People build [Cyclekarts](https://www.cyclekartsgb.com/members-cyclekarts) which are styled after cyclecars but use modern
GX200 engines. They tend to include lots of non-functional parts for aesthetic reasons, like fake exhaust pipes etc., which I don't really support.
I don't want to make an imitation of a cyclecar, I want to make a real one.

There is [a road-legal cyclekart](https://www.cyclekartsgb.com/geoffs-hornet) which gives a good guide to the standard
you need to aim for and it looks eminently achievable.

I think this looks like more joy and less expense than buying a classic car.

But I don't want a GX200 with a CVT, I want something more like a pit bike engine.

I have put some notes in [MSVA](msva.md) about the requirements.

I think mostly:

 * keep it below 20hp so you fit in "heavy quadricycle" regulation instead of "car"
 * keep it below 250kg so you don't need to mess about with seatbelts
 * brakes on all wheels
 * all the lights

I would be looking at something like a ZS190 pit bike engine. And I would want a bench seat that can accommodate 2 at a push, but absolutely no
wider than necessary.
