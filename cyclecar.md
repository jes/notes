## Engine

 * ZS190 is about £900 and 20hp
 * https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/365949490285 "GY6 200cc with Reverse Gear", £500, but supposedly only 9.1hp

## Exhaust

 * ??? probably have to make your own

## Wheels

 * Royal Enfield Classic 350 front wheel is 19", spoked, and about £100 each
 * 21" motocross front wheels are probably a better choice, e.g. KX125, but then you have to find tyres
 * Pembleton Brooklands self-builds generally use 19" wheels
 * The John Haynes Austin 7 Special uses 17" wheels with 3.5" tyre width, so approx. 24" total diameter

## Fuel tank

 * You can get these plastic fuel oil tanks on eBay that you drill for your own tap

## Leaf springs

 * Cyclekart Workshop has leaf springs available for both half-elliptic and quarter-elliptic configuration, and probably approximately the required stiffness, https://cyclekartworkshop.co.uk/products/

Or this on eBay: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/145660919625

It says "max 1600kg" which is obviously way too much, so I would be removing all but 1 leaf. Compared to the Cyclekart Workshop ones these are half the price, 8% longer, 18% wider, 68% thicker.

Being 8% longer probably makes it slightly softer but not a lot so ignore that. Stiffness is proportional to `b * h^3` so 1 leaf of this is `1.18 * 1.68^3 = ~5.6` times stiffer. I think that's not
going to work.

Bot suggests trying golf buggy leaf springs! Who knew golf buggies had leaf springs? Something like "Genuine Club Car Front Spring Assembly 103628701 Golf Buggy Cart" - the best price I've found is
£85 each and I still don't know if they are actually a suitable stiffness.

## Front hubs

 * ???

## Rear hubs

 * I'm thinking taper-lock fittings.

## Lights

 * ??? Presumed readily available

## Brakes

Looks to have:

 * discs, pads, calipers, master cylinder
 * carriers for floating calipers
 * master cylinder drives 2 independent circuits (front and rear)
 * provision for cable-operated handbrake on rear caliper
 * pressure-activated brake light switch

## Reversing

 * ??? Options are skip it, add a reversing gearbox, or use electric motor
 * See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__HUgo_tAzc
 * there is a "universal reversing gearbox" for go-karts, but specifies it's good for up to 13hp - teardown begins at 10:30 in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr9sfgW3vsg - look to be approx. 3:1 reduction in reverse and maybe 1.5:1 or 2:1 in forwards?
 * also possible to buy a "GY6" reversing gearbox independently of the engine, unclear how much power it is good for, however looks to be possible to do a straight swap for a plain sprocket in the event that the gearbox fails, so could be a good choice - other than that the spline does not match a ZS190

GY6 reversing mechanism disassembly is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALu3WWRsG18 - happily, nothing inside is spinning while it's in forwards gear, I think this will be adequate provided it can be mated to either the ZS190 gearbox output or the axle.

This guy puts it on a 50hp engine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4c4AuKVVJw - he has a follow-up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJmb9dp08mQ where something did fail, but it was nothing to do with the reversing gearbox, that's encouraging.
And a teardown in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0RRHEuYprw in which nothing appears damaged.

Note the GY6 reversing gearbox has a reduced ratio in reverse, so it matters which way you drive it!

The GY6 gearbox may be able to handle more power. One guy was having the "universal go-kart" one keep skipping teeth, although I don't quite understand why, it's possible his issue was with some other part of his drivetrain.

The universal go kart reversing gearbox specs say that forward ratio is "1:1:3" and reverse is "1:2:6" - but what does this mean? It only has 2 shafts inside, should only have one ratio. This does mean that a straight bypass of the
reversing gearbox would leave you over-geared by like a factor of 3.

## Chassis

 * good Austin 7 chassis info in this vid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTUkgRdteA4 - in particular the layout of brakes, steering, and suspension
