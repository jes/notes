## Surplusness equation

examining the relationship between "free space", "used space", and "total space", like if you're considering
making a disk 10% bigger but it gets you more than 10% more free space, because the used space stays the same;
but not specific to disks, it's a very general function (how wide are parking spaces? how wide is the shower? what's
the use in earning 5% more money? etc.)

Needs a better name.

If you have used U0 proportion of the total space (say 0.5), and the total space grows by factor G (say 2),
how much U1 of the new space have you used?

U1 = U0/G

If you have free F0 proportion of the total space (say 0.5), and the total space grows by factor G (say 2),
how much F1 of the new space have you used?

F1 = 1 - (1 - F0)/G

## Utility & Morality

* exchange rate between morality points and utility points (e.g. how much would I have to pay you to steal from an old lady if noone will ever find out?)
* diminishing marginal returns to utility, because of a maximum amount of utility points you can possibly make use of in one lifetime
* morality arbitrage, if you spend morality to earn utility which you then spend on others ("OK, Pay me to steal from the old lady and I'll donate all the money to charities", robbing Peter to pay Paul)


## Products vs Techniques

In the olden days people solved problems by knowing techniques. Now we solve problems by buying products.
What have we lost? What have we gained? Give examples.

* waterproof coats (wax it yourself, or buy one)
* house insulation (use random waste, or buy insulation)
* making gravy vs buying bisto

## The decline of the physical realm

How everything in the physical world is getting worse. Roads are always closed, restaurants make you piss
about with QR codes, bins only collected every 3 weeks, etc.

## Grbl vs LinuxCNC

Grbl:

* cheaper hardware
* higher step rate achievable (compared to parallel port)
* better UIs available
* no need for dedicated PC
* less bugs

LinuxCNC:

* more features (e.g. cutter compensation, movement coordinated with spindle rotation for rigid tapping)
* supports more complex motion systems

## The tunnel locked room murder idea

Probably in 2 parts, first part with the clues and puzzle setup, second part with the conclusion

## 4 polite disagreements

A series of 8 very-short stories in which the main character disagrees with a decision made by someone else.

We explore every combination of (rude or polite disagreement), (they acquiesced or didn't), (it worked out well or didn't)

## The hero and the villain

It's a story about a series of events involving a hero and a villain, and the twist at the end is that they're the same
person. Even better if the hero's events and the villain's events are the *same* events but viewed from different perspectives
(and you only work this out at the end).
