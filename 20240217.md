## Busyboard

Making the conrod with the CNC router was a success:

I used clamping broadly the same as yesterday, i.e. bolted at both ends. It did shift around a bit as the material was removed,
but not too bad. Definitely *acceptable* for this purpose.

I wore some ear defenders which makes the CNC router a lot less unpleasant.

## Composite kitchen worktop offcuts

I did some tests with an offcut of kitchen worktop:

The material is **25mm thick**, and the best way I found to tap threads was:

 * **M8**: drill to **6.5mm**, tap up to the middle-sized tap
 * **M10**: drill to **8.5mm**, tap up to the middle-sized tap

I drilled with the pillar drill and tapped with a cordless drill.

8.5mm is the correct drill for M10. 6.5mm is slightly under-sized for M8, but the next
size up I have is 7.0mm, which is over-sized. In both cases I was unable to insert a bolt
if I used only the smallest-sized tap, so the middle-sized one is the smallest possible.

For both M8 and M10 threads tapped as above, with a full 25mm of engagement, I was not able
to strip the thread with either the impact driver or a spanner, but I was able to strip it
relatively easily using the breaker bar.

For both M8 and M10 threads, I found that if I tapped all the way to the largest-sized tap
then the threads stripped with the impact driver.

I found that the material chips out very easily.

I hit it with a hammer and it did not shatter.

So this material *may* be suitable for my purposes. It's not ideal that it chips out and strips
threads so easily, but if I'm careful I might get away with it, and it is very much a bonus that
it is free.

Pieces I have are:

 * 960mm * 460mm (some test cuts along the length of it, up to about 80mm in from one edge, so 960mm * 380mm good, but the rest potentially still usable)
 * 600mm * 500mm
 * 600mm * 400mm
 * 470mm * 260mm
 * 270mm * 230mm
 * 270mm * 230mm (again)

And parts I will need are:

 * base plate
 * table
 * 2x gantry legs
 * gantry
 * Z axis backplate

I can probably machine it with the CNC router, or, for pieces that are too big, definitely with the tablesaw, circular saw, or handheld router.

Potentially I could double up the material if I have enough, joining pieces together with bolts and epoxy.

## Micro milling machine

If I use the worktop offcuts for the frame, and I dismantle the existing milling machine to get motors, drivers, ballscrews/ballnuts, etc.,
and I use the 1.5kW spindle that I already have, and the VFD that I have in the router
cabinet, then to start making chips with the new machine I only need to buy:

 * linear rails/bearings
 * shaft couplers
 * ballscrew support bearings
 * spindle motor clamp

Which I reckon would be maybe **£150** for linear rails/bearings if I buy cheap ones on Amazon, **£40** for shaft couplers, **£60**
for ballscrew bearings, and **£30** for a spindle motor clamp, = **£280**. And if I then find that I'm dissatisfied with the
ballscrews/ballnuts from the old machine then I can replace them at a later date, already with knowledge that the machine is
going to work etc. and I'm not spending thousands upfront.

I should do some CAD to actually design the machine, and then start making the parts that I can start making, and then buy whatever
I need to buy.
