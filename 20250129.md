## Clock

I have no obligations today so it should have been a good day for clock work, however I
also have an annoying cold so I am not motivated to do much.

I am going to tinker with the clockwatcher UI a bit, maybe do some CAD for the new
remontoire bearings design.

Clockwatcher wants a plot of period against temperature, maybe amplitude against temperature.

Not showing much of any use so far:

In theory both period and amplitude should go up as temperature goes up. I think the
trend that we're seeing here is actually from the "ramp-up" as the clock reaches a steady
state, and not an effect of temperature at all. It's only been going for 15
minutes. Will let it run all the way down and see what it looks like.

Started about 10am.

After 4h20:

It's looking like the period is much more closely linked to amplitude than to temperature,
so maybe I can safely forget about temperature for now.
