## LAN Mode

I switched the Bambu printer to LAN mode but had some trouble getting it to work.

Apparently if it's on LAN mode then you need to install a MicroSD card otherwise it won't work. I don't see why
that's any different between LAN mode and Cloud mode, but installing a MicroSD card solved it.

## Sovereign Scales (3d printed)

I had an idea for how these could be 3d printed. Basically tilt it up at 45 degrees while it prints,
and have the stand be print-in-place with a knife-edge bearing, and the stand sticks up vertically
so that when you rotate it around it lifts the counterweight up off the bed.

Make the knife edge stick "upwards", and be part of the stand, and the beam will just have a triangular hole through
it, so it will be sort of an upside-down knife edge.

And we'll put a load of "holes" in the counterweight to make it heavy. And use Ruari's idea of standing the coins
up vertically so that we can make it shorter, and get diameter and thickness measured in one go.

How do we converge on making it balance? Trial and error?

Bambu Studio can tell us the expected *mass* of the printed part, but not the centre of mass.

The other option is to model infill manually and print it 100% solid, and use FreeCAD to tell us where the
centre of mass is? That is perhaps the right thing to do if you are picky about where the centre of mass ends up.

So it would print something like this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5642
