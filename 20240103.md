## Jacot Duplex escapement

Found this on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59rCIruI2cc

It has 2 locking teeth, close together, for every impulse tooth. The advantage (for me) being that the escape wheel
turns more slowly and therefore less gearing is required of the train. The disadvantage is obviously that you waste more
energy on frictional rest (but if you can lose a wheel in the train, maybe you get that back anyway?).

But let's try and lay out a normal duplex escapement first.
