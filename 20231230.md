## One-way roller escapement model

The plan was:

 * neaten up the pivots
 * stop the escape wheel from hitting the bridge (maybe shim the bridge?)
 * get some weights for the balance wheel
 * mount it on a piece of wood held in a vice
 * hook up the string and run it off a weight
 * record videos & calculate tick rate at different drive weights, and with balance weights shifted to create different "dead points"
