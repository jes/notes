## Clock

Current status is I think the latest model would work, but the wire keeps slipping in its clamps. Need to either
make metal clamps, or grind/crush flat spots into the wire, or both, and try again.

## Sovereign Scales

I have 6 works-in-progress, but I may want to switch to making them out of sheet metal and affixing the counterweight
by some other method.

## AI

Play with fine-tuning Llama.

Play with training a small model from scratch.

Play with something like https://diamond-wm.github.io/

I got the DIAMOND CSGO thing to work: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5619

It is super low res and low fps, totally unplayable. Still cool though. That screenshot is not a great example,
there is actually stuff in the world, but it got confused when I alt-tabbed away to take the screenshot.

## Selling

To get rid of:

 * broken Anglepoise lamp
 * old graphics card, Radeon RX 580 (?)
 * motorbike
 * 3d printer, if I plan to get a Bambu X1 Carbon?
