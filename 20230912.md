## Escapement

Increasing the drive torque by 2x increased the tick rate by 32%, which is much more in line with
what I was seeing in the simulation, but much worse than what I saw with the old 3d-printed
prototype. Maybe the configuration of the springs in the old prototype was actually very effective?

I think I want to get a stronger hairspring and try again.

I made a replacement hairspring out of a piece of copper wire:

Yes, works much better. Now increasing drive torque by 2x only increases tick rate by 10%.
