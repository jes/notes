## Deadbeat spring escapement

I finished modelling a prototype for this last night, started printing it now.

I put it together: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5556

But it does not work.

The first error was that the spring keeps spinning around in the anchor attachment point, that one should have been square like the one on the
balance wheel. I glued it in place to stop it spinning, but it still doesn't work.

It seems like the balance wheel swings for longer when it is moving freely than when it is being driven by the weight, so I think it does indeed
*subtract* energy with each oscillation, instead of adding energy.

I think then that this might mean that the idea of twisting strings around each other also wouldn't work.

But then how does a normal anniversary clock escapement work? Don't they deliver the impulse to the suspension spring?

I should do a F=kx simulation, but have the spring centre point move every time the weight moves past the centre, and plot
it. Does it gain energy or lose energy over time?

My plot suggests that the way I have this set up (centre point moves in the direction of travel of the mass) actually does add energy
with each oscillation, which is good.

The purple line is matching what I have in my escapement (and gains energy over time). The light blue line doesn't move the attachment
point at all, which keeps the energy constant. And the green line moves it in the opposite direction, which does subtract energy.

So then I think the issue with my escapement model is that it has too much friction. The anchor doesn't unlock until the balance
wheel is well past the centre point, which means there is too much friction for the tension in the spring to overcome.

And maybe
not enough weight in the balance wheel, which means it can only store weight in velocity, which uses up friction.

I made the standard blunder of not giving myself enough room between the frame plates to fit screws into the balance wheel.

So I'm saying obvious problems are:

 * balance wheel too light
 * too much friction in anchor/pallets
 * 3d printed spring wastes too much energy

Need to think about what to do about it. It seems like the idea should work, it is basically isomorphic to a normal anniversary clock.

## CNC machine

I've put the table back on, with the vice bolted down directly to the table (which I've just realised
is not necessarily sound until I surface off the top of the table, but never mind), and a piece of
aluminium in the vice.

I'm going to do a test cut in the top and then measure it for accuracy, with a square, circle, and hexagon
sticking up out of the top.

The recipe for the 6mm single-flute cutter was:

 * 750 mm/min
 * 10000 rpm (167 Hz)

I'm doing adaptive clearing with 3mm step over and 2.75mm depth of cut and it is working
very well! This is great.

Running a fingernail over the lines doesn't catch on them, so I think the spindle is actually
trammed satisfactorily.

The square is meant to be 10mm. With my 0.05mm vernier calipers:

 * square is 10.00mm in X, 10.15mm in Y
 * circle is 16.00m in X (as close as I can get, due to the hole), 16.05mm in Y
 * hexagon is 15.00mm in X, and 15.10mm or 15.20mm on the X/Y directions

So it looks like X is basically spot on, but Y has maybe some backlash?
