## One-way roller escapement model

The plan was:

 * neaten up the pivots
 * stop the escape wheel from hitting the bridge (maybe shim the bridge?)
 * get some weights for the balance wheel
 * mount it on a piece of wood held in a vice
 * hook up the string and run it off a weight
 * record videos & calculate tick rate at different drive weights, and with balance weights shifted to create different "dead points"

I only made one weight for the balance wheel, just to give it a heavy spot, and apart than that I "poised" it with some masking tape.
I put the heavy spot directly in line with the pallet so that the impulse takes place close to the dead point.

First results are:

So I think a bit worse than the lever escapement, but a lot easier to make.

Also, I think I should have given it more weight, because the tick rate looks to be leveling out as the drive torque
increases. So I will run the same test again but with a static load of 7 nuts, to get data for 8..14 nuts.

It stopped once, while on 12 nuts, but I started it again and let it run a few more laps so that I could get a
measurement.

I think the issue is that there is too much friction in the frictional rest. Reducing the size of the roller table
would probably help, but I have to bear in mind that I need to be able to make it at a third of this size.

Wow!!

If it weren't for the fact that it stopped once, I would say this is almost ideal.

You can clearly see that the time for one revolution of the escape wheel varied by only 5 frames of video across
the entire run, so it's almost at the point where I need to be timing it via the audio track instead of the video.

I didn't have enough of the same nuts to actually add a 7-nut weight, so I approximated it using some different
nuts, which could be why it seems discontinuous with the previous graph.

Another possibility is that the mechanism is very sensitive to the angle at which it is mounted. To re-wind the
string I pivot the mechanism about its screw and poke out the barrel pivot, but that means when I put it back
it is only as repeatable as the Sharpie mark. Although by comparing the footage it looks to be positioned at
an almost identical angle in each case. So I'm guessing the discrepancy is due to an error in the mass of my
"7 nuts".

This graph almost makes me want to add even more weight just to see how it eventually goes wrong, but I can't be
bothered.

I never observed the behaviour where the reverse swing pushes the escape wheel all the way back to frictional rest,
which is a shame. Probably the roller table needs to be smaller so that the friction torque is lower.

What I want to look at now is making a software model of this escapement so that I can explore the design space more
quickly. It would be good to be able to reproduce charts like the above, showing that tick rate increases with drive torque
up to a point, and then plateaus.

Variables in the simulation are:

 * coefficient of friction
 * roller table diameter
 * angle during which the escape wheel can engage the pallet
 * Young's modulus of spring
 * moment of inertia of balance wheel
 * drive torque

Simplifications:

 * the drop is instantaneous
 * frictional rest resumes instantaneously as soon as the impulsing tooth escapes the roller
 * drive torque is constant as long as the escape wheel is not in frictional rest
