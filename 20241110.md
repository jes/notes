## Sovereign Scales

One more go at sheet metal Sovereign Scales today. Things to remember were:

 * watch out for travel moves that are too low, make sure they are Z10 or higher
 * flip the aluminium sheet over
 * drill the pivot hole in the beam at 1.1mm
 * run the 6mm end mill at 6750 rpm, 112.5 Hz

The alignment holes are at X5Y5 and X5Y180

Well I've cut out the parts, only one small blunder where I reran the pocketing toolpath
with the 1mm end mill installed. But actually, how did that manage to cut so deep?
Wasn't Z set the same for each? Obviously my Z height setting needs work.

The quarter sovereign pocket is less than 1mm deep, aren't these all meant to be 1.5mm deep?

Updates:

 * after every job that requires a tool change, move up in Z and Y
 * write a playbook or whatever
 * tile the build plate and do N in one go
 * more substantial tabs on stand (currently 1mm long, needs to increase - or add more?)
 * make sure tiled tabs don't get cut off
 * check depth of quarter sovereign pocket
 * see if we can do better at Z height setting

## CNC machine

Something is clicking on Z moves, should investigate that. Also check backlash.

With an indicator mounted on the vice and touching the spindle housing,
I get **0.04mm** movement by manually pushing the table back and forth in Y,
**0.15mm** by pushing the spindle back and forth in X.

By putting the indicator on the vice and touching the end of the X ballscrew,
I can still get **0.15mm**! So the error is coming from the BK12 bearing block?
Even though I put a shim spacer inside it? No! The error is still there if I put
the indicator on the end of the *linear rail*. So the issue is gantry stiffness.

All of the bolts on both of the uprights were slightly loose, but tightening
them hasn't helped with stiffness.

And the Z axis clicking? Only observed on slow Z moves. It goes away if I loosen
the bolts holding the motor mount, and then the motor mount is visibly wobbling
around. Is the coupling pressed up too tight so it can't slip?

No, I pulled it down a bit and tightened everything up and it is still clicking.

The bolts holding the motor to its mount were loose, I've tightened them up
and the clicking is gone.
