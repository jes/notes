## Stepper motor clock

I used the bandsaw to cut down an old CPU heatsink: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4922

So now I have 20 aluminium rectangles, about 49.5 * 27 mm, and 1.1 to 1.3 mm thick (slightly
tapered). What could I do with these? Use them to make small watch parts? Maybe I could make
my "micro CNC mill" and make it hold blanks of about this size?

I used the milling machine to tidy up the cut edges, and trim some more fins off to provide
space for mounting screws. Great success: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4923

Ruari says it will be an expensive clock to run if it needs such a big heatsink, but I'm not so sure.
The transformer says the output is "12v ~ 2W", and the transformer isn't getting appreciably warm,
which makes me think it's drawing less than the 2W that the transformer is rated for. I think the
motor just gets hot because basically all of the power it draws is turned into heat, and it's not
very efficient at shedding heat.

But I went to measure how much current it is drawing, only to find that my multimeter can't
measure AC current, so I've ordered a clamp meter. I'm also going to leave the motor running
for a bit and see how hot it gets. Started at **14:20**. Without the heatsink it got too hot
to touch in well under an hour.

Next to the material I cut it out from: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4924

There's hardly any of the original surfaces left, but probably still slightly less work than machining
fins out of a solid block.

**14:43**: it's warm but not excessively so, maybe the temperature of a hot bath. Maybe about 40 deg. C?

The heatsink feels hotter than the front of the motor does (the back of the motor is the hot bit), so I
think the heat transfer into the heatsink is adequate.

**15:38**: broadly the same as before. I reckon about 40 deg. C. So I reckon it has stabilised, and the
heatsink works. Great success.
