## Car front brake hub

It doesn't quite clear the wheel.

I debated using a Dremel tool to take the lip off the wheel but decided that is too much trouble for not enough benefit, so I'll just
make the hub part slightly taller. And this won't necessarily drastically weaken the stub axle because the bearings are still inside the
wheel, so the part of the stub axle that ends up longer because of this can be very thick.

You have to imagine the brake disc and caliper.

I think it would be prudent to 3d-print the steering upright thing before making it in metal, to make sure the caliper is going to fit.

To suit the flanged allen bolts that I am currently using to hold the disc carrier on, I will want a counterboring bit that uses an 8mm pilot
hole and makes a 17mm flat. I don't know if such a thing exists, so potentially I use a counterboring bit for a bigger pilot hole and turn the
pilot part down on the lathe to fit an 8mm hole??

OK, so after discussing with ChatGPT, I have learnt that having M8 bolts spanning this gap is not going to work. The bolts will bend instead of
transmitting torque from the brake disc to the wheel and the wheel hub will deform.

The hub needs spot-facing on the outside anyway, I have ordered an M10 x 18mm spot-facing tool and will turn the pilot diameter down to 8mm.

I will also spot-face the hub on the inside, and then I can seat a big steel spacer against it on the inside. Make the spacers long enough that the
disc carrier is seating on the spacers instead of the spigot. And then it can all be bolted up tight without bending the wheel hub material,
and then the bending load will be taken by the spacer instead of the bolt. It just requires all the spacers to end up the same height, when
accounting for the depth of the spot-face, but I think that will be OK. I can fit them by hand by incrementally facing them down on the lathe,
and maybe marking which one goes where.

I'm doing a Rapid Metals order:

 * EN8 steel for front stub axles: 25mm diameter, 200mm length, 2x
 * EN8 steel for front stub axle spacers: 35mm diameter, 100mm length, 2x
 * EN8 steel for rear axle: 25mm diameter, 1200mm length
 * EN8 steel for rear wheel "sleeves" in bearing holes, 42mm diameter, 16mm length, 4x
 * EN8 steel for hub spacers (to attach wheels to front disc, and rear taper lock things), 18mm diameter, 100mm length, 24x
 * aluminium for front disc carriers: 94mm diameter, 38mm length, 2x
