## Captive lever escapement

I realise I am essentially speed-running the development of the Swiss lever escapement here,
but this is a simple modification to my lever escapement that would give it the behaviour of
"locking", and decoupling the escape wheel from the balance wheel.

But we still don't need banking pins or the safety guard pin thing.

We modify the tooth form to add a locking face (like on the Roskopf pin pallet escapement),
but we let the pallet pin bank against the wheel, instead of adding a banking pin for the lever,
and we keep the roller pin captive inside a slot in the lever so that it can't fall out.

Here's a quick sketch:

So let's try and CAD this. We can use the current frame and balance wheel, just need a new lever
and escape wheel.

I'm finding it hard to find a configuration that is actually going to work. So, back to the
simulator...

I came up with this escape wheel: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4670

Down to only 14 teeth instead of 20 now. Not necessarily a problem, but means we need 10/7 the ratio
in the train.

The lever is the same as before for now, which makes it quicker to test, but if it looks promising I can
make a lever with more space relieved in the "slot", to allow the balance wheel to swing freely
while the escapement is locked.

The thickness holding the tooth to the wheel is only 3mm, which turns into 0.5mm at 1/6 of the
size, not sure if that is going to be strong enough.

## Blued pivot steel

I've ordered a selection of blued pivot steel for making pins etc. out of, because it's not
expensive and more convenient than turning down the silver steel rod. Ordered from Cousins UK,
I spent Â£40 and am getting a tiny amount of metal, this is maybe not great value.

## Next steps

* make a 3d-printed prototype of the captive lever escapement and decide whether it is an improvement
* make a metal prototype of a lever escapement, and with a separate driving barrel as well?
* make a 3d-printed prototype of the case, allowing winding and setting
* make a 3d-printed prototype of anything driven by a coiled spring

## Ceiling

Good progress:

But ran out of screws now, ugh. Only a tiny bit more to go.

## Bangle.js commute timer

I'll copy over the json log to `commute.json` and try and work out why the delta time is so wrong.
It must be something to do with the formatting, not the variable, because `display_delta_secs` is
used to find the ETA and that looks fine.

OK, one dodgy bit is it is called `display_delta_secs` but the ETA has a comment saying it is
in milliseconds, and no conversion factor is applied.

Errr... or maybe the fact that the ETA is meant to be in milliseconds is why it looks so
believable. It might not actually be right, it might just be taking our whacked-up delta time
and dividing it by 1000 so it has less of an effect...

I found that in `updateTiming()`, `time_to_target` was in ms but `elapsed` was in seconds, which
means `elapsed_at_target` is not in any particular unit. This might be the cause of the problem.

I've fixed it on the watch and in `~/commute-timer`, and I've updated the `commute.json` file.
Great success.
