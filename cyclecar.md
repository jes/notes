# Cyclecar

## Engine

ZS190, supposedly 16hp.

## Exhaust

 * ??? probably have to make your own

## Wheels

I have some 17x1.6" wheels that look to be front wheels from a motorbike, they have one side open where a drum brake assembly could fit and the other side blank.

## Tyres

Bot says the biggest tyre you can put on a 17x1.6" wheel is 3.00-17, and for example a Kenda K272 looks good and is about £45 per tyre.

## Fuel tank

 * You can get these plastic fuel oil tanks on eBay that you drill for your own tap

## Leaf springs

I've ordered front leaf springs for a "Club Car" golf cart. They have 2 leaves but I will remove one.

## Rear hubs

Remove the bearings, and light press-fit a spigot inside the bore of the wheel, which has a flange
on the back, with 6x M8 bolts that go through the wheel. On the outer face of the wheel, spot-face the holes with a counterbore
so that the bolt heads sit flat.

And the spigot wants to be at least keyed to the shaft and ideally somehow taper-locked or split-clamped to the shaft.

Bolt-on taper-lock hubs are available: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6424

Which is basically what I want except it doesn't have a spigot to nicely locate it in the wheel. Maybe we could simply sleeve
the wheel hub with something that is a close fit on the axle and that is good enough? It won't spin on the axle at all, just needs
to locate the wheel concentric with the axle, and then we bolt it to the bolt-on taper-lock hub.

## Front hubs

We can use bearings inside the wheel - but probably want to increase the spindle diameter from existing 15mm. Bot suggests
you really want like 25mm. It's possible that I could make a separate "spigot half" for the inner and outer bearing, and
have bearings larger than 42mm outer diameter but they sit outside the wheel hub, but I think not necessary.

But a "6905" deep-groove ball bearing is 42mm outer diameter, 25mm inner diameter, 9mm thickness, cheap and
readily available. Alternatively
a "71905" angular contact bearing fits in the same dimensions (also 9mm thick) and takes higher load, but costs over £100 each.

And then we need something, probably bolted through the wheel, to carry the brake disc, with clearance for the caliper.

## Lights

 * ??? Presumed readily available

## Brakes

Looks to have:

 * discs, pads, calipers, master cylinder
 * carriers for floating calipers
 * master cylinder drives 2 independent circuits (front and rear)
 * provision for cable-operated handbrake on rear caliper
 * pressure-activated brake light switch

I've ordered one.

### Front discs

 * Diameter: 126.5mm
 * Thickness: 3.5mm
 * Bore: 47mm
 * Holes: 6x 6.5mm holes (to suit M6) on 58mm PCD

And needs I think at least 25mm clerance from the inside edge of the disc to the nearest surface of the wheel, for caliper clearance.

### Rear disc

 * Diameter: 220mm
 * Thickness: 3.5mm
 * Bore: 58mm
 * Holes: 4x 8.5mm holes (to suit M8) on 80mm PCD

## Reversing

I've ordered a "universal go-kart reversing gearbox". It is sold as being suitable for up to 13hp, but a unit that looks equivalent is sold elsewhere for up to only 7hp, so unclear how well this will hold up. I
guess we'll find out.

Teardown begins at 10:30 in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr9sfgW3vsg

I think the ratio is 1.25:1 in forwards mode.

### GY6

Another option is a "GY6" reversing gearbox.

GY6 reversing mechanism disassembly is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALu3WWRsG18 - happily, nothing inside is spinning while it's in forwards gear, I think this will be adequate provided it can be mated to either the ZS190 gearbox output or the axle.

This guy puts it on a 50hp engine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4c4AuKVVJw - he has a follow-up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJmb9dp08mQ where something did fail, but it was nothing to do with the reversing gearbox, that's encouraging.
And a teardown in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0RRHEuYprw in which nothing appears damaged.

Note the GY6 reversing gearbox has a reduced ratio in reverse, so it matters which way you drive it!

The GY6 gearbox may be able to handle more power. One guy was having the "universal go-kart" one keep skipping teeth, although I don't quite understand why, it's possible his issue was with some other part of his drivetrain.

## Chassis

 * good Austin 7 chassis info in this vid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTUkgRdteA4 - in particular the layout of brakes, steering, and suspension
