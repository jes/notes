## Case

At night I was imagining how the case would be made, and worked out that it's not
actually obvious how the face will be attached. If the bezel is attached to the
outer barrel, and the hand is attached to the inner barrel, what can the face
be attached to?

So I think it can't actually be wound by the "bezel", the bezel needs to be fixed to
provide something to hold the face.

Also, it's still not actually clear what the bearing surfaces for the barrel parts
will be. Will need to figure this out otherwise it will end up sloppy and will wear
out quickly, or not even work.

## Metal escapement prototype

On to making the frame pieces...

I used WD-40 as flood coolant this time, and the 2mm 1-flute end mill. They're made out of 2mm sheet.

First part: 7m19s, 330 mm/min.

Second part: 6m12s, 400 mm/min (+20%)

It didn't seem any more unhappy at 400 mm/min than 300, so I've updated [micromachining.md](micromachining.md)
to say 400 instead of 330.

I weighed the WD-40 bottle before and after the second part, it reduced from 531.1g to 508.9g,
which means I used 22.2g. I bought 5 litres for £35, assuming 1 litre = 1kg (it's actually less than
1 kg/litre, which means this is an under-estimate of the cost), I used about 15p of WD-40. Not a problem
for now but it could add up if I make a lot of copies of something.

2mm sheets of aluminium can be had on eBay for £75/sqm (probably for much less if you look harder). My frame
plates use up about 0.002 square metres, so I also used about 15p of material. Spraying the WD-40 has doubled
the consumables cost! Although, for that matter, I probably spend more on broken tooling than on either materials
or WD-40.

I'm using straight pivot holes for now because I don't have a tapered reamer. I'm also not burnishing
the pivot holes yet (does that work in aluminium?)

I couldn't be bothered trying to make 4 identical pillars on the lathe, so I tried this instead:

Looks like it might be asking a bit much though. If it doesn't work I could retry with a finer quality mode,
or maybe sacrifice the locating feature and settle for vertical cylinders. Or just make them on the lathe
like I should have done.

Update: it didn't work. The bore is too small, the locating feature is too big. I'm going to try vertical cylinders.

I made some vertical cylinders but I only had 2 screws long enough: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4639

With 1 nut it just barely runs, ranges from **6.8 to 7.8 Hz**.

With 2 nuts, from **9.6 to 9.8 Hz**.

With 3 nuts, from **11.1 to 11.2 Hz**.

The tick rate is way too fast, so I need to add weight to the balance wheel. I also definitely want to add a hairspring.

## Rain

We've had our first decent rain since I finished the roof. Nothing coming in through the roof or around
the edges, but there is a very tiny drip coming from the gutter where I siliconed it. I'm not quite sure
how it is getting in. I won't be able to easily undo the gutter to re-silicone it so I think the plan is
to wait for it to dry, put some silicone on a paper towel, and reach in and smear it around the join
using the paper towel.

Update: it's coming in where I've sealed against the funny wall. Need to get up there and do some more
silicone probably.

## Next

Next things to work on:

* Make some sort of prototype of the "lever" version of the escapement.
* Consider trying to use the 4th-axis to machine some perimeter holes in the balance wheel (will need special workholding).
* Think about how to fit the hairspring.
* Make a 3d-printed model of the watch case, showing how winding in one direction freely spins the outer barrel, and in the other direction moves the movement (including hand).

## Roof stuff

* put the little OSB boards up to keep wildlife out
* run the cable for the light
* silicone gutter
* silicone roof by weird wall
* put up insulation by stapling it to wood
* OSB up in alley
* plasterboard up in conservatory
