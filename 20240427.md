## Machine building

The upright bolts nicely to the inserts I bolted in:

Not perfectly square, but I'm not sure how bothered I am. Maybe worth addressing
just to improve the contact surface area:

The rails and BK12 bolt on nicely to the gantry, thankfully:

And works when I drive it with the drill:

That's good because it means everything is square and parallel enough not to bind up.

For fitting inserts to the other side of the baseplate, I'm going to need to widen this hole:

I ummed and ahhed about what to do, but then decided that since I'm using the template to align it
for gluing anyway, the actual hole doesn't need to be very precise. So I widened it using a Dremel
tool:

And now the inserts fit in on the template, and they're gluing now. I'm also gluing the
BK12 and linear rail inserts for both the Y axis and Z axis, which is all the gluing I can do until
I drill more holes.
