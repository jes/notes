## Car front hubs

The wheel hub has 3 "prongs" inside the gap between the bearings. I have ground these down with an angry-end to allow a 30mm rod to pass
through. I must remember to order some material to make spacers to go between the wheel bearings, when I order the material for the front uprights.
