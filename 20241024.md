## Sovereign Scales

I'm going to CAD the "folded sheet metal" version, to see how big it ends up being. The good news is if I align the
fold lines with the X axis then the centre of mass doesn't move in X when I fold them up. So I can get FreeCAD to tell me
the location of the centre of mass, and I know it needs to line up with the origin.

Also, I can try moving the coins closer to the pivot, but making the beam wider so that they're still constrained,
and see which direction that moves the centre of mass. It might be better to overlap the coins more even
though it will require a wider beam, if the shorter beam means the centre of mass moves in.

First impression is that increasing the width doesn't change it by much, but moving the coins closer to the pivot makes
a big difference. So we would prefer to make the beam wider and move the coins closer.

FreeCAD keeps segfaulting, very frustrating. https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/17447

Something like this could work: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5630

And they tessellate like this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5631

So there is *room* for 14 of them on the table, with gaps big enough for a 6mm tool to get through.

And actually if we tile them this way then there is room for 16: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5632

Although then there is *not* a lot of room for bolts to clamp the plate down.

So I'm imagining:

 * first operation to put score lines on the bottom where the folds will go
 * in the same setup, underside engraving, if any?
 * underside v-bit deburring, if any? may not be worth it because of alignment requirement
 * then flip it over with alignment as good as I can muster
 * topside engraving, if any
 * 6mm pocketing
 * 1mm slotting
 * v-bit deburring toolpath, if any
 * 6mm cutting out, leaving small tabs

## CNC Machine

I'm going to finally take the time to clean the chips off the machine, maybe tidy up the rest of the garage,
check all the bolts on the machine, maybe Loctite them. And put an indicator on the spindle to see
if that is where the chatter is coming from.
