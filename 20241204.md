## Clock

Just for some amusement I ran the clock this evening. The only change
since last time is I moved the remontoire weight marginally closer to the gear, i.e.
slightly less drive torque on the escape wheel.

I definitely want to be able to run this for longer so that I can spot environmental
effects.
