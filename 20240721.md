## GPT Blotto

The plan is to make Colonel Blotto: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blotto_game - except you play against GPT4o.

The Colonel makes his allocation and sends you a SHA256 commitment. You then make your allocation and send it
to the server, and you get to find out his allocation and the text to prove his commitment was valid.

Then he gives some analysis/commentary/coaching, and you can chat to him if you want, and then the next round starts.

It will be interesting to see if the user can manipulate him into making bad moves via the chat box. Also whether
we can get him to manipulate the user.

How could you set difficulty settings? Just ask the Colonel to play bad moves?

I think I want a DALL-E art of the Colonel to use on the web page.

The backend will be Mojolicious, communication over websocket.

I got ChatGPT to write the user interface, I just gave it a description of the websocket protocol, and it worked, incredible technology.

Current status is:

 * the game works
 * it doesn't play Blotto very well, you can beat it by just going all 10s every round
 * the user interface could be nicer
