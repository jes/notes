## Spring-driven mechanism

Let's just make a 3d-printed coil-spring mechanism to turn a hand via a basic runaway escapement of some kind.

You can make a spiral in FreeCAD by using "Additive Helix" in "Height-Turns-Growth" mode, and setting height to 0,
with nonzero radial growth.

1. make a coil spring
2. make it live in a frame, with some way to wind it and some way to capture the output
3. make it drive a few gears, with a hand and an escapement

Here's a coil spring: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5123
