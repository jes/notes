## Stepper motor clock

I'm printing the electrics cover that I designed yesterday, using "Organic" supports.

Lol, great, I forgot to put a hole in it for the cable.

Great success, clock is done, video of assembly and explanation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yroDFrE3mJQ

## SCAMP

I had a look at the assembly for `eval_function` but couldn't see anything obviously wrong.

However I did notice a few places where instructions like `ld r0, 0` are still being generated,
which should preferably be `zero r0` instead, saving one word each time. These are not output directly
by the compiler, but created by the peephole optimiser. I added another step to the peephole optimiser
that fixes these up, and it has shaved enough off the kernel that I can move the start address up by
another 256 words! Now starting at `0xd500`. Very good. And the library blob is down to 9380 words.

So this was both much easier and much more effective than the thing that optimises constant initialisation
of globals.

I'd like to compare the state of the system from the end of last year's Advent of Code to now, measuring:

 * Where does the kernel start? 0xd200 -> 0xd500
 * How big is the library blob? 9634 -> 9380 (-2.6%, -254)
 * How much space between blob and kernel? 43870 -> 44892 (+2.3%, +1022)
 * What is the largest succeeding 2d `vzmalloc` under `slc`? 201 -> 204 (+1.5%, +3)
 * What is the largest succeeding 2d `vzmalloc` under `slangi`? 142 -> 146 (+2.8%, +4)
 * How long to boot to the shell? 2.70s -> 2.56s (-5.2%, -0.14s)
 * How long to run 2022 day14 part1 in `slangi`? 18m11s -> 16m35s (-8.8%, -1m36s)

**So: it boots 5% faster, the interpreter is nearly 10% faster, and there's 1K words more free memory.**

The program for testing `vzmalloc` was:

    var i = 0;
    while (1) {
        i++;
        vfree(vzmalloc([i,i]), [i,i]);
        printf("%d\n", [i]);
    };

## Socket cover

Lucy keeps slobbering all over one of the sockets in the living room, and she gets very upset when
pulled away.
So the plan is to design a box that can go over it using the existing mounting screws.
