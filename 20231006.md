## Temujin

https://www.temujin.ai/CAM is a web-based CAM tool that makes CNC CAM as easy as 3d print slicing.

It even gives you a visualisation of the material "left behind" in the corners: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4779

However it does think a 1mm tool can get all the way into the 0.3mm radius at the root of the teeth.

Also it's not actually open source, so maybe not to be trusted.

It ramps the cut though, which FreeCAD doesn't, and it seems to all run in JavaScript so maybe worth taking a local copy of this.
And the code isn't minified!

I downloaded it with "Save Page As..." but it doesn't work.

First problem: it loads some stuff with `crossorigin="anonymous"`, just deleted that.

Second problem: some of the JavaScript files are "modules", which result in Cross-Origin errors when loaded from local filesystem,
even though it's the same origin. Is this deliberate or just not tested properly?

Looks like it is deliberate: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/1888 and https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/8121

8121 suggests:

> We have to spam &lt;script&gt; tags from &lt;script src="./least_dependent.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; to &lt;script src="./most_dependent.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt; rinse and repeat for however many libraries or extra program files we have, then we can finally do &lt;script src="main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;.

OK, so will this work? No, I don't think so. I think you have to change everything to not use `import` syntax as well.

I think I just have to suck it up and run `SimpleHTTPServer`.

Now the problem is that "Save Page As..." didn't save all the files that were imported. Such fun.

I manually downloaded the rest with `wget`, but now it has the issue that half of the stuff refers to `Temujin_CAM/files/` and half of
it refers to `static/js/`. I'm going to ditch the "Save Page As..." version and get them all manually. Probably once I
have it working I want a script to automatically download the latest version so that I can stay up to date.

Changes I want to make:

* fix the font size
* remove Google stuff
* remove everything that `POST`s
* self-host "lil-gui", and anything else that is fetched externally

Update: actually I think all the toolpath generation is done by the `/reach` endpoint :(. Sad times, no self-hosting.

## Github 2FA

Ugh, I went looking to see if Temujin actually *is* open source, and now github makes 2FA mandatory. I've put the 2FA setup
key & the recovery codes in `keys`.

I tried to use Gnome Authenticator but it doesn't exist in Ubuntu 20.04 apt. I tried to install it from snap but it doesn't work
because AppArmor blocks it from using the Gnome keyring, or something.

I'm using `oathtool` with `oathtool -b --totp $key`.

Lol, after going through all that, https://github.com/temujin is not even related.
