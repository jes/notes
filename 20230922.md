## Captive lever escapement

I realise I am essentially speed-running the development of the Swiss lever escapement here,
but this is a simple modification to my lever escapement that would give it the behaviour of
"locking", and decoupling the escape wheel from the balance wheel.

But we still don't need banking pins or the safety guard pin thing.

We modify the tooth form to add a locking face (like on the Roskopf pin pallet escapement),
but we let the pallet pin bank against the wheel, instead of adding a banking pin for the lever,
and we keep the roller pin captive inside a slot in the lever so that it can't fall out.

Here's a quick sketch:

So let's try and CAD this. We can use the current frame and balance wheel, just need a new lever
and escape wheel.

## Blued pivot steel

I've ordered a selection of blued pivot steel for making pins etc. out of, because it's not
expensive and more convenient than turning down the silver steel rod. Ordered from Cousins UK,
I spent Â£40 and am getting a tiny amount of metal, this is maybe not great value.

## Next steps

* make a 3d-printed prototype of the captive lever escapement and decide whether it is an improvement
* make a metal prototype of a lever escapement, and with a separate driving barrel as well?
* make a 3d-printed prototype of the case, allowing winding and setting
* make a 3d-printed prototype of anything driven by a coiled spring
