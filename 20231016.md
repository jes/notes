## Stepper motor ratios

I reckon it's converging towards 10.24 seconds/rev exactly.
So far, after nearly 23 hours, the average rate is 10.23977 seconds/rev.
That is a difference from 10.24 of under 2 seconds per day.

I will leave it running for longer, but on the basis that it is exactly 10.24 seconds/rev,
what are the best ratios to use to get hours and minutes?

I want to use a "Geneva drive" on the output of the stepper motor to drive the train,
both because it will result in large pauses between intermittent motion, which I think
is fun, and because it makes for an easy place to put the "anti-reverse" feature: make
an asymmetrical slot in the Geneva drive, with something that can catch the pin if it
tries to turn backwards.

Actually you could do that with Involute gears too, if you angle the back surfaces
of the gear so that they won't turn past each other, I think. Let's have a quick
look in FreeCAD.

Something like this? https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4842

Anyway. The gear ratios.

We get one turn every 10.24 seconds at the motor, and we want one turn every 3600 seconds
for the minute hand. So it needs to be slowed down by a factor of 5625/16.

If we assume a Geneva drive on the stepper motor, with 1 driving pin, then we get one *tooth*
every 10.24 seconds at the start of the train.

One option is 1:20, 8:45, 8:25. The stepper turns once every 10.24 seconds. The first
wheel turns once every 204.8 seconds. The second wheel turns once every 1152 seconds.
The third wheel turns once every 3600 seconds.

Another options is 1:25, 6:25, 8:27. Needs a slightly-larger driven wheel on the Geneva drive,
but does not need the big 45-tooth gear.

Can you do it with fewer wheels?

What about 1:75, 16:75? First wheel turns once every 768 seconds, second wheel turns once
every 3600 seconds. Needs a monster 75-tooth Geneva driven wheel though.

What about 1:45, 16:125? A 125-tooth gear is even more monster, but at least the Geneva-driven
one is smaller.

Also I found that after having been running for a day it takes much less torque to stall the motor.
Is that just because it's got hot and the resistance has increased? I've ordered a 6v transformer.

And let's just use 3 wheels. Less trouble that way.

## Metal escapement

I resumed yesterday's task and completed steps 7 and 8, fitting the pins into the pallet fork
and the balance wheel, using Loctite. Next up is to assemble it and see if it all lines up any better than before.

Hmm, it looks like the location of the pallet fork is incorrect: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4844

Probably because the pivot is too eccentric so it couldn't get pushed all the way into its hole in the die block.

I forced it along a bit with the tweezers and managed to assemble everything: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4845

However the pallet pins seem to have got bent. Maybe they need a "boss" in the fork to fit in, so there is more than
0.5mm depth of engagement. In fact maybe that would be a good idea for everything that has to fit a pin/shaft.
Or maybe the issue is that the router doesn't drill straight holes.

From working it by hand, it seems like at the point of one pallet pin unlocking, the other pallet pin
lands on the *impulse* face of its next tooth, instead of on the locking face. This is not what happens in CAD,
or in the bigger model, so this is an error in making the parts. In fact, there is a point where the escape wheel
can spin almost freely, hardly touching the pallet pins at all.
