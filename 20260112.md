I used about 2.5 big cans of grey primer.

So far I've used 4x 400ml cans of the "Paint Factor J.D. Green" from Amazon. It is quite thin, doesn't cover well,
not really satisfactory.

I noticed that the bolt that holds the brake disc carrier on was loose again, I took it out and it is obviously damaged:

So I think this method of keying things to the axle is definitely not good enough. The plan is to make a split in the disc carrier and use a clamping bolt
to tighten it to the axle. Currently the screws holding the brake disc only go halfway through the thickness of the carrier, so if I put the clamping bolt
in the back half then it won't interfere. If it does interfere then I just have only 5 screws holding the disc on, no big deal.

If I were to do it again I would not cut so much material away - you only need enough of a flat for the nut/bolt to clamp against - and I would cut the
split in a straight line with the bandsaw instead of doing it with the hacksaw because I'm too lazy to drag the bandsaw out. But I think this will work.
