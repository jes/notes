## ChatGPT shell

Following on from yesterday's blog post: https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/chatgpt-linux.html

It would not be too hard to replicate this functionality, but in a way that it works on my own server's
instead of on ChatGPT's sandboxed environment.

 * use the OpenAI "assistants" API
 * give it a function that can execute python code (and maybe others for convenience, like directly execute bash command lines, maybe one that changes the prompt to something useful)
 * every "command line" you type goes to the "assistant", and it can respond with both plain text and with function calls
 * syntax to allow you to directly run shell commands yourself? (prepend with an '!' ? like "!sudo apt update" to run it directly?)
 * a way to let you double-check the output before executing it?
 * a way to abort a command that is about to be executed
 * make it work as a non-interactive "shebang" tool, so you can write "chatgpt shell scripts", and it has a modified system prompt so it won't try to interact, each line is sent as a separate question to ChatGPT and it gets to see the output before doing the next line - maybe we even tell it the whole script upfront so that it knows what it will have to do with the output from each line, before we prompt it with each line individually
 * give it a consistent environment instead of a fresh one each time (e.g. if it assigns to environment variables they should persist, if it changes directory that should persist)

It would be too slow and expensive to use as an everyday shell, but a fun project anyway, and maybe more useful in future.

There is prior art:

 * https://www.gptshell.cc/
 * https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt
 * https://github.com/0xacx/chatGPT-shell-cli

Example of what I have in mind for a "chatgpt shell script":

    #!/bin/gptsh
    list (ls -l) the files in ~/Documents and the backups in ~/backup
    backup any new or modified Documents to a new tar.gz file in ~/backup

And you can imagine that it would note the modification timestamps of all your documents and make a new backup file with only those ones in.
It can do this with either Python or directly with bash, you don't care, as long as it works.
