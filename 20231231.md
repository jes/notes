## Roller escapement

Overnight I was thinking about how to reduce the "drop", mainly so that the reverse swing doesn't lose so much energy.
I had a few ideas:

1. incline the impulse slot backwards so that the tooth lands earlier
2. incline the tooth backwards so that the edge of the tooth lands against the corner of the slot, instead of the tip going all the way in
3. make the slot "mushroom shaped", so that the opening is smaller than the gap inside, so that the tooth can't drop in so soon
4. make the tooth hook-shaped, almost matching the radius of the roller, so that when the tip drops, another part of the radius
lands on the corner of the slot and hasn't moved very far
5. make the escape wheel really big, and with loads of teeth, so that the teeth are practically moving in a straight line as they pass through the roller
6. add a hook to the end of the impulse slot like on the virgule escapement (but without making the spokes of the escape wheel able to
pass underneath it)

Some of these will obviously be challenging to make at watch scale, but I want to play in CAD to see what I can find.

### Inclined tooth

I've also slightly mushroomed the slot (i.e. the sides bulge
outwards so that the cavity is larger, relative to the opening).

This example (`inclined-tooth.FCStd`) has the escape wheel
move 1.4 degrees for drop to impulse, impulse for 23 degrees, and then 1.3
degrees to drop the next tooth to frictional rest. It provides
impulse for 66 degrees of roller rotation.

The drop to impulse is 6% of the impulse.

One downside is that due to the undercut, it can't be cut
with a fly cutter, so would need to be cut
with the CNC router, but the radius is too small.

### Hook tooth

This example (`hook-tooth.FCStd`) has the escape wheel
move 1.7 degrees for drop to impulse, impulse for 23.3 degrees,
and then 0.7 degrees to drop the next tooth to frictional rest.
It provides impulse for 54 degrees of roller rotation.

The drop to impulse is 7% of the impulse.

You can see that the radius on the tooth is just slightly larger
than that of the roller, so that when the tip drops into the
slot, the base stops it from dropping too far:

What's the best I can do for a hook tooth that engages with the
existing roller? Then I can quickly print a new escape wheel
and test it today.

Mmm, not very good. Without the undercut on the slot it binds up:

### Large escape wheel

Let's keep the teeth roughly the same but make the escape wheel
2.5x as big.

This escape wheel is now about 49mm across, so obviously too large
to work. It has 35 teeth. This is up from 20mm across and 14 teeth.

I think it was basically already as large as it can feasibly be,
at least without scaling down the teeth and the roller.

### Conclusions

Maybe the hook tooth idea is good, but it needs a different roller, so
it's slightly inconvenient to test. I'll add a "loose thread" for it,
and move on to tidying up and fixing the mainspring barrel.

## Loose threads

 * experiment with hook-tooth roller escapement
 * experiment with a virgule-like hook on the impulse roller
 * make the thin mainspring barrel work properly, or rule it out
 * make a 3d-printed spring-driven escapement work
 * make a metal version of the single-impulse roller escapement
