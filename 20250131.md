## Haynes Motor Museum

I went to the Haynes Motor Museum yesterday, I didn't take any notes or photographs at the
time, but I recall thinking these cars are cool (pictures found online, not necessarily the
exact car from the museum):

John Haynes' modified Austin 7: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5948
Elva: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5946
MG Midget: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5945
Austin Healey "bug-eyed" Sprite: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5944
Riley Brooklands: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5943
Yellow Porsche 911, round headlights: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5947
Peugeot 205 GTI: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/594nc2

I seem to like open-top classic sports cars.

## Moodboard

I wanted to make a moodboard of the cars to show Emma, but the moodboard app isn't
working!

nginx is giving "502 Bad Gateway", it is configured to reverse-proxy to port 10303, and
"curl http://localhost:10303/" isn't working even after I start it with docker.

OK, the issues are I was putting `--restart=always` at the end of my docker command line,
which means it passes it to node instead of to docker, and node rejects it and exits.
And that it forwards port 10303 to some random other port instead.

Not sure why it stopped working if it obviously worked before, but fixed now.

## Clockwatcher

I'm reading "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" by Edward Tufte. It has
convinced me that I should review the graphs on clockwatcher.

Mainly, they should use thinner lines, be a lot smaller, and all fit on the screen
at once.

It is kind of absurd that I have a 4K screen and can only see 4 simple plots at a time.

I think this is an improvement: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5950

Though still lots of unused space.
