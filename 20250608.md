## Workbench

Plywood top is now fitted, legs cut down by 50mm as it was a bit tall,
diagonal braces underneath the plywood, horizontal braces on the lower
level, and plywood lower level now fitted.

Next up is MDF on top, then mounting vices, and I think I'm done with it.
Also want to do some sanding of the frame to smooth it down a bit.
