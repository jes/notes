## CAD model of house

Now with textures on the porch & dining room roof, and start of loft:

Still needs the interior walls of the loft, the main roof, and chimney cavity wants connecting.

Then decide whether to print as-is, or put a brick texture on the exterior walls.

And then once printed I can maybe make drop-in interiors, particularly for kitchen and bathroom.

## Anniversary clock

In anticipation of the thicker suspension spring arriving, plan was:

 * reduce the gap between the forks
 * make it so I can access the bolts on the fork without twisting the wire

So I really only need to make a new fork.

And I've checked it still has clearance.

Apparently the new spring is not expected until Tuesday, that's annoying. I'll have to think of something else to work on until then.

Also:

To clamp to the spring to give me a way to rotate it more precisely, to fix beat error. This will go just above where the spring is
clamped to the holder. Adjustment is by loosening the screws that clamp the spring to the frame, rotating the lever, re-tightening the
screws.

A better design would have the spring clamp rotating inside another clamp, but this will do for now.

And if I have to work on something other than the clock, I should try to think of something to make on the CNC machine, just to
convince myself it is all working, if nothing else. Ideas include:

 * emboss some text on a piece of aluminium with F-Engrave
 * try to cut some steel
 * toolrest extender for Ruari's lathe
 * or work on cable management, or moving the electronics to grblHal
