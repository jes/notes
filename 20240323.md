## Machine design

I've laid out the latest parts on the material in CAD and verified it still fits.

Just needed to add bolt holes for Y rails.

Some of these parts need machining on both sides, but that won't be too much trouble.

Plan:

1. use the tablesaw or circular saw to do the cuts marked red (and mark part names in Sharpie): https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5369
2. for all except the uprights, do the CAM for the first side, load the material, run the first side
3. for all that require machining on bottom side, do that
4. work out how to make the uprights
5. glue in threaded inserts, install rails and check for squareness
6. glue doubled-up parts together
7. assemble the machine?

## Machine building

Firstly I need to install the new ballnut seals. Straightforward enough, they still seem a bit on the tight
side, but at least I can actually turn them by hand now.

I've done all the cuts in red above, so now on to CAM. Let's start with the smallest part, that would be the
Z plate.

The CAD of this part doesn't yet have the holes to attach the spindle clamp. Let's worry about that later.

Doing the smallest part first is good because if I fuck it up I have enough spare material to make another.

What sort of end mill do you use for this? Maybe a 6mm 2-flute down-cutting bit?

Feeds & Speeds tool suggests starting at 8000 rpm and 2000 mm/min feed rate, with 3mm depth of cut, full
slotting. Let's give it a go...

I think do a first job with clamps to put the holes in place, then bolt it down through the holes, then remove
the clamps and run the outer profile.

Also this is the first time I've used the CNC router since I reassembled this spindle motor, and I recall
it was getting warm quite quickly when I tested it, so need to watch out for it overheating.

The first job was just the counterbores for the holes. It went very well, didn't make nearly as much dust
as the tablesaw did, was more making chips. It didn't actually reach 2000 mm/min, but at least I have
learnt that 8000 rpm and 1000 mm/min makes an acceptable chip.

To make the actual holes I need to use a smaller tool. I never know what to do for this sort of thing:

 * use drill bits and actually drill the holes? (not convinced this machine is rigid enough)
 * use a 3mm or so end mill and interpolate the holes? (slow, and needs a long, narrow, fragile tool)
 * use the chamfering tool to mark the location and then drill with the pillar drill? (more manual work, worse quality holes)

I think I'll look for a small end mill to do it with. My 3mm tools have 1/8 inch shanks and aren't long enough.
I'm going to try with a 4mm 4-flute up-cutting tool. Tool says 12000 rpm, 1100 mm/min, 2mm depth of cut, full
slotting.

Also, I need to remember to do all the CAM on the garage computer so that I'm not constantly walking back
and forth between garage and office.

The 4mm up-cutting tool seemed to work fine. This stuff cuts very easily on the CNC router, so far there
is much less mess, noise, and dust compared to using the tablesaw, circular saw, or handheld router.
