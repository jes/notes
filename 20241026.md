## Tablesaw gear

The PAHT-CF seems to be printing fine, although I accidentally printed it in "Extra Draft" mode, not sure how that
happened. I'll probably just accept it and install it like this, but should remember to switch to "Strength" for next
time.

I also forgot to switch to the 0.6mm nozzle, but I'll not bother doing that for now, 0.4mm seems fine.

Looks OK, although thin wall thickness due to "Extra Draft": https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5637

If it breaks I will give this material another chance before resorting to a metal one.

I've superglued it onto the handle, and reamed it with a 12mm reamer. It's installed now, but I want to give it
a bit longer for the glue to set.

## CNC Machine Ballscrew Locknut Spanner

I'll print this one in "Strength" mode.

It is warping a bit, I forgot to use glue stick.

The shim washers have arrived, so I can put the bearings back together.

All of them are back together, and installed, just waiting for the locknut spanner to tighten them up.

The spanner works OK, it splays apart at less torque than I'd like, but I am able to put on way more torque
than I was before.

This is the technique: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5639

Put half of the coupler on the shaft and use a screwdriver or something in it to hold the shaft still,
and then tighten the nut with the plastic spanner.

I have reversed the BK12 blocks on the X and Y axis compared to before, to get an extra 5mm or so of travel on each axis,
and this means the motor mounts are now too short.

Oh well, good opportunity to print new ones in PAHT-CF!

I've extended it by 3mm compared to what was already in CAD, however I can see that the model in CAD does not
match what I have in reality, so hopefully I hadn't already extended it by too much or something.

CAD now is: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5640

About 2h30 to print in PAHT-CF in "Strength" mode, and the part looks really good.

Also the mounting screw inserts for the X axis were both loose, I've put them back in with superglue but may need something
better. In principle I could bolt all the way through the gantry with nuts on the other side, because I do have access
to the back.

Could this be the elusive cause of the chatter?
