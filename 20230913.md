## Roofing

I fitted the last of the barge boards: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4623

Ugh - I didn't buy enough. There is just that little sticking-out corner piece next to
the substation not done. I'm considering bending up some of the offcut of roof sheet to
make a little bit of barge board. Not sure.

Also finished up siliconing. So hopefully it is watertight now.

Oh, I forgot to do the gutter again. Try to remember to do that when I make the barge board piece.

* Tidy up the desk
