## Workbench

Plywood top is now fitted, legs cut down by 50mm as it was a bit tall,
diagonal braces underneath the plywood, horizontal braces on the lower
level, and plywood lower level now fitted.

Next up is MDF on top, then mounting vices, and I think I'm done with it.
Also want to do some sanding of the frame to smooth it down a bit.

## Don't do that

I'm thinking of writing a blog post on the list of reasons we tell children
not to do things.

 * might hurt yourself or others
 * might damage property
 * might lose something
 * might make a mess
 * rude or threatening or otherwise disrespectful
 * noisy or otherwise disturbing or distracting
 * prevent you from eating your meal later
 * prevent you from sleeping later
 * violates social norms (e.g. wearing clothes in public)

More generally:

 * Harm (to yourself or others or animals)
 * Burden on others now (cleaning up a mess, repairing/replacing damaged/lost objects, disturbing someone who is concentrating)
 * Burden on others in future (won't eat meal, won't go to sleep)
 * Violation of social norms (wear clothes, don't point at people, don't say rude or aggressive things)

So these are of 2 kinds:

 * You can't do it, for your own good
 * You can't do it, for someone else's good

And if you assume that others might exact some sort of retribution if you do something bad to them, it all comes down to:

 * You can't do it, for your own good

Although hurting others is still bad even if you are completely sure they
won't retaliate.

## Sundial angles

At the moment the sundial is exposed in the morning by the shadow of the ridge
of the house moving back towards the house. I expect that at some time of year,
it will instead be exposed by the low sun moving around the side of the house.

I took some measurements with the sextant, with the mirror approximately
at the centre of the sundial, and the height read off the sextant and bearing
read off the sundial as a solar time.

As viewed from the sundial, the silhouette of the house is approximately
like this:

 * A: 7.05am 38&deg;
 * B: 7.15am 39&deg;
 * C: 7.30am 39&deg;
 * D: 7.30am 30&deg;
 * E: 7.50am 27&deg;
 * F: 7.35am 34&deg;

What dates will the sun be at those angles at those times? And then
we know that the day before the shadow will be revealed up/down, and the
day after it will be revealed left/right, and hopefully on the exact day the
corner of the shadow will cross the surface of the sundial.

Obviously they are local solar time, so I want to convert to GMT and potentially
BST to work out the actual time of day.

How do you work out the direction to the sun at a particular time?

https://www.sunearthtools.com/dp/tools/pos_sun.php?lang=en I think this tool
does what I want.

Hmm, actually, I have misunderstood something here. The angle of the gnomon
shadow is not the same as the angle of a vertical rod's shadow! So the time
doesn't directly point to the sun direction. And actually I think
the times I wrote down are the angles of the **pm** times.

So let's just convert those to azimuth angles.

 * A: 38&deg; alt., 109&deg; azi.
 * B: 39&deg; alt., 112&deg; azi.
 * C: 39&deg; alt., 116&deg; azi.
 * D: 30&deg; alt., 116&deg; azi.
 * E: 27&deg; alt., 122&deg; azi.
 * F: 34&deg; alt., 117&deg; azi.

And then dates and times (from trial and error on SunEarthTools) are
approximately:

 * A: 9.49am, 29th of July
 * B: 9.59am, 1st of August
 * C: 10.09am, 8th of August
 * D: 9.42am, 31st of August
 * E: 9.58am, 7th of September
 * F: 9.57am, 22nd of August
