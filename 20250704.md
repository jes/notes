## sqlite auto-migrator

The plan is to make a tool that will read a `schema.sql` and an existing database file, and make a new database
file with the new schema, copy all the data from the old database file for tables/columns that already existed,
and then move the new database file on top of the old one.

And make it available as both a CLI tool and a Go module.

It took 15 mins to get a basic working version, including unit tests. It's 12730 chars of code, which means an
average speed of 14 chars per second or flawless 170 wpm typing for 15 minutes straight. Incredible technology.

Meanwhile you have people all over Hacker News saying that LLMs are useless? WTF?
