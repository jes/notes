## Car wheels

Turning the wheels around is definitely going to work. I did a few 3d-printed iterations of the carrier today,
I have another one to make tomorrow. The latest one has excessive clearance between the caliper and the wheel (so the
disc could move closer to the wheel centre), and interference between the caliper and the disc carrier (so the
carrier needs more material removing).

Next one is shorter, and has a big chamfer on the interfering part.

I also drilled one of the BF12 bolt-on hubs to have 8mm holes, and I cut off lengths of the tubing to make spacers,
and faced them all off to ~equal lengths. They ended up between about 18.32 and 18.36 mm long which I think
is more accurate than my spot-face depths.

I sat them on the spot-faces and laid a straight-edge across them and I found that a much bigger problem than drilling
them all to equal depths is drilling them all parallel to the axle. Some of them were off by like 15 deg.! I think from now
it is an iterative process of comparing pairs of spacers with a straight-edge and "adjusting" the spot-face until they
look like they are all pointing in the right direction, and then I can worry about making them equal depths.
