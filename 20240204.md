## Escape wheel shaft

Let's try and make the escape wheel shaft. I think I will blue a piece of 3mm silver steel, because I recall
that in the soft state it didn't turn very nicely.

The tricky part is workholding for the 2nd operation.

I think probably I want to make the long end first, and then somehow clamp on the 0.8mm diameter.
Maybe I drill a 0.8mm hole in a piece of aluminium and then superglue it into the hole, and then
I can at least make the right geometry, and then it just becomes a problem of extracting it from the
aluminium? Let's go with that.

The first side went *OK*, not great. I need sharper tooling. I only have one tool with an actually
sharp radius, it is a random HSS one, and it is not ground very well. I should make an actually
sharp tool of some sort.

And supergluing the part into the aluminium doesn't seem to be going very well, the glue is not
setting, maybe because there is no air getting in? I'll just leave it for a long time.

The glue broke off quite early :(. And, strangely, the part is scrapped because the 0.4mm diameter
pivot piece also broke off. I don't know if the pivot was all that was actually glued properly,
or if after the glue broke, the piece became loose, allowing the pivot to get pressed against the
inside of the hole and then break off.

I could really do with some small collets for holding these small shafts.

Next time:

 * make a nice sharp tool out of the 6mm square tool steel (try using it as a hand graver?)
 * make the shaft diameter 1mm instead of 0.8mm, and hold it with the 1mm collet
