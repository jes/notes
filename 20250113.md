## Anti-friction wheels

Third time lucky, hopefully.

The plan is mostly the same as last time, but for a 5mm shaft instead of 10mm, and
open up the hole diameters so that the drill goes straighter when drilling out to 1mm.

One issue is that the bobbins have to be a lot smaller in order to not interfere with
each other. I think the solution is to stagger them. So make them slightly shorter (not ideal)
and put 2 spacers on each bobbin.
One would have 2 spacers at the front, one would have 2 at the
back, and one would have 1 at each end.

Actually, update: I think my last CAD was pretty much correct, I just made the bobbins
too small? So I just need new bobbins.

The bobbin very obviously doesn't match the master sketch.

Well I made one and tried it out.

But this is just very obviously much worse than the micro bearings. I didn't get as
far as installing it in the frame, I just spun the escape wheel in it and compared to the
micro bearings.

So I think switch to smaller diameter shaft for the escape wheel and remontoire,
with correspondingly smaller bearings. Also could put an actual bearing on the remontoire
weight. And maybe soak the bearings in alcohol to thin the oil?

I've ordered some 3mm aluminium rod, and "693ZZ" bearings.
