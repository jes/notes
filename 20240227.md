## Pugsender

I've added a grbl simulator to Pugsender. This will be mildly useful for testing the application without having a Grbl
connected, but will be very useful for unit tests, and will also be a handy way to test out different Grbl configs,
and differences between Grbl and grblHAL, without having to reconfigure any hardware.

I'm dissatisfied with https://github.com/256dpi/gcode as it requires gcode to be uppercase and have spaces, even though
Grbl is happy to accept "g0x5" instead of "G0 X5". So I need to either fix it, or just fork it. My guess is that that
change wouldn't be accepted, so I may have to fork it. While I'm at it I should also separate out my grbl interface
stuff to a separate library so that it can be used in other applications.
