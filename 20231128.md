## Continuous remontoire

The Harrison clocks all have remontoires that rewind periodically, getting more frequent as they get more advanced.

Instead of a periodic rewinding, why not have the remontoire be completely continuous? I.e. it is a component
that passes torque only up to a given limit.

You could imagine providing torque via a torsion bar, so that as more torque is applied, the bar twists more.
Then you have a sliding piece keyed to one end of the bar, with "axial cams" on a disc at the other end of the bar,
so that as the bar twists, it pushes the sliding piece axially, and you'd have the sliding piece operate a brake
on the input, so that the input is braked proportionally to its torque.

Does that get you a constant torque output, or does the output still increase as the input increases? It feels like
the latter to me, but maybe it is adjacent to an actual solution.
