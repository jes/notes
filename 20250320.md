## Secondary object

So the plan is to draw the secondary object by drawing a second
fragment shader on top of the first.

I literally have no idea what I'm doing, just have to hope Claude can
figure this out.

Whoa it is working!

That's the untransformed rounded box being drawn on top of the main scene.
I'm ditching the `applyToSecondary` thing, I'll eventually just make
translate/rotate a part of each node and then it will get applied
automatically.

I think I want a bit more of an abstraction over shaders.

I want to be able to "compile a shader" and add it to the scene, and
set uniforms or whatever, without the renderer having to really know
anything about it.

So I want some sort of object that represents a "render layer", and
the object contains a reference to the compiled shader or whatever,
and also stores the values of the uniforms. And then you add that object
to the renderer and it just draws it as another layer.

And each frame you can update the uniform values in the render layer
object if you want, or leave them alone and they'll stay the same.

We'll use that to set the object colour initially, and then
subsequently we'll be able to specify node parameters with uniforms.
