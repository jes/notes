## Machine building

I've put the Y axis ballscrew and rails in, seems to work: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5419

I've discovered that the screws I'm using to attach to the carriages are just slightly too long,
need to either cut the ends off or buy some shorter ones.

And then after chiseling off the epoxy and filing down the inserts: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5421

One of the inserts in the X carriage is only half as long because of the cut-out underneath it, this one pulled out
when I tried to chase the thread in it, because I guess the tap bottomed out on the epoxy that had squeezed out on
the underside, and the joint wasn't strong enough so it drove the insert upwards. Need to redo that one.

Also need to mix some epoxy & Minerva powder to fill the gaps around these inserts: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5422

So plan is:

 * re-glue the short rail insert in the X carriage
 * put filler around inserts in baseplate
 * get shorter screws for bolting to linear rail carriages (48x)
 * assemble Z axis
 * assemble the frame, square up all the axes, put epoxy putty (?) filler on the gantry mounts
 * motor mounts
 * install in laundry basket
 * hook up to LinuxCNC for first tests?
 * fit spindle motor
 * get a VFD
 * replace LinuxCNC with grblHal

I'll do the gluing now. The screws only want to be about 2mm shorter, maybe 27mm long? 26mm long? 25mm would probably
do.

I mixed the filler with 1 part resin, 1 part filler, 2 parts powder, by weight. So 50% powder.

I was driving a screw in and out of the threads to make sure there was no resin stuck in the threads, but it was pushing
air up into the filler on the left-hand insert, so every time I drove the screw in it bubbled up and every time I took
the screw out it sucked the filler back down. So I'm settling for leaving it high and filing it down after it has set.
Hopefully it doesn't all drain into the thread and block up the hole.
