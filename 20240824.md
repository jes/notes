## Deadbeat spring escapement

I finished modelling a prototype for this last night, started printing it now.

## CNC machine

I've put the table back on, with the vice bolted down directly to the table (which I've just realised
is not necessarily sound until I surface off the top of the table, but never mind), and a piece of
aluminium in the vice.

I'm going to do a test cut in the top and then measure it for accuracy, with a square, circle, and hexagon
sticking up out of the top.

The recipe for the 6mm single-flute cutter was:

 * 750 mm/min
 * 10000 rpm (167 Hz)

I'm doing adaptive clearing with 3mm step over and 2.75mm depth of cut and it is working
very well! This is great.

Running a fingernail over the lines doesn't catch on them, so I think the spindle is actually
trammed satisfactorily.
