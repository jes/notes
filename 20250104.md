## Clock

I'm going to try again to get it to run down with the clockwatcher taking a trace, and
this time I won't disturb the cables etc. while it's going.

If the clockwatcher has a connection problem this time then I'll try to debug it.

Started at 12:50.

Meanwhile, I can CAD and print a larger gear for the winding drum to increase the running
time.

I only have a tiny amount of the white PLA left, hopefully the machine realises it has
run out and lets me load a new spool. It did! Good.

I asked ChatGPT what sort of string is best to use. It suggested low-friction low-stretch
string (duh) and suggested that braided polyester is a good choice, so I've ordered some
braided polyester string.

Kind of looks like period tracks temperature pretty closely! Hotter makes slower, as you'd
expect.

It ran for about 90 mins before running out of string:

So, yes, looks like it very obviously slows down with heat, as expected. And
it stayed within about 2.5ms of period variation over the 90 minutes, which would correspond
to varying by 41 seconds per day.

I'm going to fit the bigger gear and see if it will run. I went up from 43 teeth to 100 teeth.

With 12x drive nuts and reduced remontoire weight, it is running, with about 200 degrees
amplitude. And I guess we expect it to run for about twice as long as before because the
gear has about twice as many teeth.

During the 90 minutes, the weight dropped by maybe 50cm and then I was out of string.
Which means if the weight can drop by 2 metres then it should have run for 6 hours before,
so about 12 hours now, if it had enough string. So about a factor of 700 remaining.

Started at about 15:04.
