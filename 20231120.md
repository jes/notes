## 1x escapement

I'm printing the escape wheel on a 2-layer raft, to see if it works any better.

The pinion sheared off while drilling it out again. Now I'm reprinting it with flow rate bumped from
95% to 98%.

I've assembled these parts:

The pivots on the balance wheel are very stiff, and the shaft is too long, which means I can't screw
the balance cock down properly, and also the pallet fork hits the end of the pivot
that sticks out the top.

Need to:

 * free up balance wheel pivots
 * make balance wheel shaft shorter

Even with flow rate increased you can see the spokes are not fully solid:

However I have managed to drill it without shearing the pinion, so that is good.

And all assembled! https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5030

It looks like it might work if not for the balance wheel pivot issues. And the barrel successfully
turns the escape wheel! Incredible.

I shortened the shaft on the lathe. It seemed to be working better today, leaving a better finish, a
sharper shoulder, and being less likely to break the insert. I was using 2500 rpm instead of 2000, maybe
that makes all the difference.

## Carriage DRO

I modeled this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5031

It uses 2x 10mm neodymium magnets to stick to the bed, one to stick to the carriage, and 2x M3 countersunk
screws through the jaws to hold the Vernier caliper on. It also has some teeth on the part that attaches to
the bed to stop it from sliding, but maybe that is a bad idea, because:

 * there has to be some clearance to allow it to be installed, so it can still slide a bit anyway, I'm just less likely to notice
 * if it can't slide, then crashing it rips it apart instead of just moving it

I did the CAD on the milling machine PC, very convenient because it is right next to the lathe. Would be more convenient
with network access.

Great success! I used it to discover that 1 turn of the handwheel moves the carriage 3/4 of an inch.

I've removed the threading dial because it crashes into the plastic, but I could cut a notch out of the plastic
if I really want to use both at the same time.

## FreeCAD

I have a number of ideas for FreeCAD improvements:

1. some way to abort a long-running calculation early
2. some way to do the background computation on a remote machine
3. the "export STL" should open with the current directory set to the directory of the `FCStd` file I'm exporting,
   or at least the last place I exported an STL from the current project, rather than the directory of the last place
   I exported *any* STL.

## Stepper motor clock

The Digi-Key parts have arrived. I should do my CAD updates and then start building the other clocks.

I have found a piece of bamboo chopping board for one and some birch (beech?) to use for the other.

## Scotch Yoke clock

I have some A4 sheets of 8mm plywood, might be nice to make the Scotch Yoke clock out of these.

I'm imagining the frame, gears, and pendulum top made out of this plywood. The roller would be a
105ZZ bearing as at the moment. The pendulum rod would be a dowel, thinner than at present, and would
have a M6 rod at the bottom to hold the bob, with adjustment nut.

In principle I want the clock to run for as long as possible on a single winding, but given this will
be my first actual clock driven by a falling weight, maybe I shouldn't be too ambitious. Maybe just
target 1 day of runtime and see how much weight it ends up needing, and then I can think about being
more ambitious for the next one.

Features:

 * workings as visible as possible
 * wound up by a key, with a ratchet
 * include a second hand (remember Harrison's idea of a wheel that goes around once every 4 minutes, and only
   exposes the seconds on a quarter of a rotation, but with 4 hands)
 * set the time by moving the minute hand (but don't make this change the second hand - just the minutes and hours)
 * Scotch Yoke "escapement", obviously
 * wooden frame, but brass bushes for pivots
 * pillars also wooden, fitting in slots, maybe with wedges to hold them in place
 * hangs on the wall

## Next

 * re-fit the balance wheel to the 1x escapement and test it
 * design a clock for the Scotch Yoke escapement
 * update stepper motor clock CAD and start making parts
 * fix the garage roof leak
