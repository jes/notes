## Balance wheel

Here's a balance wheel on the balance shaft: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5262

It is a slightly loose fit so will want Loctiting, but I won't do that until after I've machined the rollers.

And I seated the hairspring by tapping it with the staking punch, seems like it might work? https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5263

Next up is to make the mainplate, balance cock, and adjustable cone pivot, so that I can check that it runs freely without
a hairspring, and then check that it swings back and forth freely with the hairspring.
