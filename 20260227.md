## Car engine mounts

The plan is to work out roughly where I want the bolt holes to be, and then machine slots in them, drill holes in the spacer block
for M8 clearance, bolt everything up, then tack the mounts in place with the engine bolted in, to make sure it fits, and then
weld in place.

I had trouble getting the holes to all line up while it was sitting in the chassis, so instead my solution was to bolt it up on
the bench and then hammer the angle iron parts into the chassis.

It may turn out that as soon as I unbolt it I won't be able to
get it to line back up again, in which case I will have to try to work out which direction to widen the slots. But that's
a problem for the future.

I've only tacked the angle iron pieces in place, just in case I still want to remove them. But probably I won't.

The yellow-zinc-plated clevis-looking part is for tensioning the chain. I think I want to use it, so the mounts for the gearbox
will be a couple of sheet metal bracket parts that pick up one of the holes on the gearbox and slot around the chassis rail and
get welded to the chassis, and then somehow another bracket nearby that the clevis-looking part can bolt through. With spherical
washers? Or what?

And then I'll use the clevis-looking part to tension the chain between the gearbox and the axle, and then slide the engine to
tension the chain from the engine to the gearbox. Annoyingly, sliding the engine means the exhaust will need to be able to move
on its mounts, but you can get flexible exhaust pipe so maybe that would be good to use.

## Beer review

Sam said it is an Imperial Stout, about 12% alcohol, and made with vanilla and toasted marshmallows. He described it as a "big beer"
and kind of implied that I may not be man enough to drink it. This evening I worked up the courage to give it a go.

There was just a very slight hiss as I popped the stopper on the bottle.

The appearance is not dissimilar to well-used engine oil. I almost expected it to leave a coating on everything it touched, but it didn't.
Sam said it pours like syrup and I think that description is pointing in the right direction.

I tried to shine a light through it but it didn't work. I'm not sure I've ever seen a beer this utterly opaque.

The slight fizziness gives you just the faintest hint of a head, made of very fine bubbles. It builds up more if you swirl it around in the glass.

It smells nothing like it looks. I can agree that it smells of marshmallows, but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have said that if I
didn't already know. To my mind it smells like it ought to be a much lighter colour. It smells a bit like sweets.

It's hard to describe the taste. I'm not good at describing tastes at the best of times and this is a very unusual taste.
I'd say it tastes like beer, yes, but a beer that is somewhere towards a sweet coffee.

It leaves my lips feeling slightly sticky.
Even a small sip feels like it fills your mouth.
In many ways it is more like a wine than a beer.

Maybe it's just the 12% Imperial Stout talking, but I think this is genuinely the most I have ever enjoyed a beer.
As I near the end of the glass, each mouthful is tinged with the regret that I am one mouthful closer to having run out.

I love this beer.
Is there anything like this I can buy off-the-shelf?
How do I get more of this?
