## Clock

In the absence of the thicker wire, I wondered what would happen if I put the "twisty threads" balance on this escapement:

Answer: it doesn't work, flutters badly, loses energy. There are 2 obvious reasons:

1. the cotton thread stores energy so poorly that it's like having a super duper weak spring
2. the cotton thread has a natural twist in it, so the centre position isn't even with the thread completely untwisted!

I think give up on this idea. Maybe try taking all/most of the weights off the balance to see if that helps. But this is
just an interesting side track anyway, because I already know this balance is nowhere near isochronous.

Other ideas are:

 * connect up a normal pendulum instead of the torsion pendulum, shouldn't be too hard
 * try to make a grasshopper escapement

A bit more on the loft:

Still needs:

 * chimney holes connecting up
 * chimneys should stick out above roof
 * roof
 * locating features for putting the loft on
 * boxing around pipes etc.?
