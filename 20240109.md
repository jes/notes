## Balance wheel

Here's a balance wheel on the balance shaft: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5262

It is a slightly loose fit so will want Loctiting, but I won't do that until after I've machined the rollers.

And I seated the hairspring by tapping it with the staking punch, seems like it might work? https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5263

Next up is to make the mainplate, balance cock, and adjustable cone pivot, so that I can check that it runs freely without
a hairspring, and then check that it swings back and forth freely with the hairspring.

Progress is slow because it is cold and unpleasant in the garage so I keep stopping.

## VHS Tapes

I put some isopropyl alcohol on the tape and then tried to play it, with the aim of cleaning the head,
but disaster struck! It ripped the tape! How is that even possible. So now I've buggered up the good tape.
Need to find out whether Michael wants me to try to repair it or just leave it alone.
