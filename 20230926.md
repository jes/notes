## Plan

Print out the guard dart system, make a longer spring, try it out, plot natural frequency of balance wheel
& isochronicity charts again.

Tidy the garage, clean the lathe, make a chip-guard for the back of the lathe.

CAD a Douzieme gauge, make it, blog it.

## Hairspring winder

Well I printed the guard dart system out but I couldn't wind a satisfactory hairspring by hand, so I designed
this hairspring winder based on one in the "Watch and Clock Making and Repairing" book:

Here's the one from the book:

The idea is you hook 3 pieces of wire to the inside of one piece, and feed them through the slots
in the other piece, and then rotate the pieces to coil the 3 wires up tightly together, and then you take
it apart and you've got 3 hairsprings. Will it work? I don't know. The most likely failure is that the
3d printing is not precise enough to properly constrain the 0.7mm wire.

I had a lot of difficulty loading the wire, because it keeps falling out of its hook. I think if it were a hole
you poke it in instead of a hook that lies in the same plane, it would be easier. I eventually taped down the
3 pieces of wire, with the idea that the winding motion would rip the tape off.

I also had a lot of difficulty bolting it up, because I had to hold an M3 nut and bolt at the same time as holding
the lid shut with my fingers. I should put an M3 insert in the bottom part.

I also had a lot of difficulty doing the winding, because the tool is so small. I think it would be better if the
handle on the top part were easier to grab, and if the bottom part had a rectangular piece to clamp in the vice.

When I opened it, it looked like this:

So the tape didn't rip up as easily as I hoped, and also the pieces didn't clamp together firmly enough so the wires
were able to ride over each other.

Also it doesn't spring out very much once it's released, so I should make it bigger.

Let's try and design an improved version, using what we learnt...

I know it looks similar but it is much larger. The grip on the top part is 10mm tall instead of 3mm.

## Douzieme gauge

I designed this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4701

Based on the reference photo from the other day: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4690

I'm planning to drill a hole on the inside of each leg and bend up a bit of stainless wire to make
the spring. The pivot will be held together with an M3 bolt with a big washer, with one leg tapped, and maybe
loctited. I still need to make the engraving pattern for the scale.

It's meant to be made out of 3mm steel, but if I find that too annoying I may revert to aluminium.

## Garage

Garage is tidied, lathe is cleaned: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4705

After lunch, make a chip-catcher.

Probably also want to fit the new blade to the bandsaw, and put it away somewhere, and maybe
look at the tailstock of the lathe and see why it doesn't clamp properly any more.
