## Roof

I finally siliconed the gutter. I also bent up an offcut of cladding to make the last bit of barge boards, and fitted them.
So I think the exterior is now 100% done! Great success.

Emma and I tidied up a bit in the alley and conservatory, and tidied up the garage, and took photos of the surplus
motorbike parts and I listed them on eBay.

Next up is measuring & ordering wood and plasterboard.

## Watch

So let's try and procede on CAD'ing the metal escapement prototype. This is what I have so far: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4624

I think I'll make life easy for myself and skip the separate gear & barrel, I'll just make a frame that can hold these 2 parts,
and has some space for me to add the extra bits later. It would be good just to build this up to the point that I can turn the
escape wheel with my finger and see it ticking.

Needs a way to attach the hairspring.
