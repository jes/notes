## Metal escapement

I want to make the parts in an order that will allow me to check the interaction of the escape wheel
and pallet fork as quickly as possible. So I need:

* frame plates
* standoffs
* escape wheel
* escape wheel shaft (but no pinion needed)
* pallet fork
* pallet fork shaft
* pallet pins

And then I can try to turn it by hand, and work out whether/how to proceed.
