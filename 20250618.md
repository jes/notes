## Rod arms

I'm going to try to make some rod arms out of flat bar.

Here's a first attempt:

That was cut 150mm long and then bent in half, with the idea that it would be long
enough for the long arms, which are 60mm between hole centres. It was not long enough
so I made a short arm instead, 25mm between hole centres.

It was relatively easy.

I bent it cold. Drilled it after bending so that the holes definitely line up.

I didn't have a piece of 12mm steel handy so I used the unthreaded portion of
an M12 bolt, it measures 11.8mm diameter.

The split in the clamp was just the thickness of the bandsaw blade, and the split closes
up before the clamp is fully tight, so the split wants to be wider.

Other than that, I think a good success. It lacks any facility for keying, but I can
do that later if it proves to be necessary. So I guess widen the split in this one,
then make another like this, then make 2 larger ones.

OK, slight change of plan. I don't have a 16 mm drill suitable for steel, so I tried
drilling the 16 mm hole with a masonry bit, but it took ages and didn't work very well.
So the new plan is to turn the ends of the kingpins down to 12 mm instead.

The longer arms need a 10&deg; bend in them to account for the steering axis inclination, I
made the bend by clamping an M12 bolt in the big hole, bolting an M8 one in the small hole,
hammering on the M12 bolt to bend it, and then sliding the kingpin (with 10&deg; cross-drilled
hole) over the M12 bolt to see that it becomes perpendicular with the M8 bolt. It seemed
to work OK.

So just one more arm to make this afternoon, and then I'm done with arms.

 * one more arm
 * turn kingpin ends down to 12 mm
 * cut spindles
 * weld everything

Looks good, just waiting on the steel delivery now.

## Steering box

These parts have printed: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6227

In yellow ABS-GF because I can't imagine wanting to use the entire spool of it otherwise. And this is
just "0.20mm standard" settings. The plan is still to reprint in PC-Max once satisfied.

The bearings are a very tight fit, but they do go in.

And I can't see if the gears mesh properly because I don't have shafts yet. I think steel is arriving
today.
