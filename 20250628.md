## Rear axle

I finished machining the flats on the rear axle, it went well, and the wheels fit.

Great success, this is a good milestone. Also proves that my machine fix was good.

I still need to somehow make it so that the wheels are held on. My original plan was to
thread the outside of the ends of the axles M20 and use M20 nuts, but since I can't stick
this material through the lathe headstock I may have to do something else.

Either cross-drill and use a split pin, or drill the ends to take M8 bolts or something and use
spacers/washers to hold the wheels on? Unsure which I prefer. The split pin idea sounds not
very good, the wheels would always have some play in them. But drilling a hole straight down
the end of the shaft sounds quite tricky, and then I have to faff about finding suitable
spacers and washers. Not sure yet.

And in either case the axle may want cutting down slightly, I think it is still longer than
it needs to be.

## Sprocket hub

I made the sprocket hub, wasn't too hard except hacksawing it to length was quite a workout.

The hub and axle both need cross-drilling for mounting it, but I was tired after hacksawing so I
stopped for today.
