## Escape wheel shaft

Let's try and make the escape wheel shaft. I think I will blue a piece of 3mm silver steel, because I recall
that in the soft state it didn't turn very nicely.

The tricky part is workholding for the 2nd operation.

I think probably I want to make the long end first, and then somehow clamp on the 0.8mm diameter.
Maybe I drill a 0.8mm hole in a piece of aluminium and then superglue it into the hole, and then
I can at least make the right geometry, and then it just becomes a problem of extracting it from the
aluminium? Let's go with that.
