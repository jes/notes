## Car front uprights

The front upright needs:

 * kingpin
 * stub axle
 * brake caliper bracket
 * track rod arm

I'm going to start in CAD by positioning the stub axle and brake caliper bracket, then the kingpin, and then work out
where the track rod arm should be.

The brake caliper bracket needs to have 2x M8 clearance holes that are 64mm apart from each other, 12mm inboard of the inner
surface of the disc, and at 52mm radius from stub axle axis.
