## Partners in Crime

We've played a lot of "Partners in Crime" but the word list is getting old,
need to think of new words. A good word is something that has multiple meanings,
a lot of them tend to be both a verb and an unrelated noun.
Existing words include:

 * record
 * bat
 * tap
 * wave

Other good ideas would be words that are really hard to represent, and homophones,
because even if they aren't spelt the same you might still work out what your
partner has drawn. Also words that are similar but different, for example
"noise" and "sound" might confuse each other.

We'd also want a way to shuffle the deck without unpairing the pairs. And a
way to do scoring that is more convenient.

I'm working on a list here: https://github.com/jes/partners-in-crime-wordlist
