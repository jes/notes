## Escapements

Yesterday I mentioned the idea of an "escapement" where a pendulum is powered by a crank, and
by chance I stumbled across this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgTg4eoje-I which has
a pendulum with a crank on it!

That example actually has the pendulum powered by a separate (Galileo?) escapement, and the pendulum is
driving the crank, but the connection between the crank and the pendulum is exactly what
I had in mind. I imagine that if you removed the escapement and hung the weight off
the wheel with the crank, it would drive the pendulum.

## Milling machine

I went out to try and make the pins/shafts for the 1x escapement model, but I did not have great
success.

Firstly `mk-pivot` was acting like it wasn't even doing anything. I tried re-zeroing the A axis
at 180 degrees to see if the compensation in `mk-pivot` was backwards, but that didn't even change
anything!

I measured Z axis backlash at 0.65mm, set 0.65mm compensation, ran it again, and now it seemed
to be over-compensating.

I think what is happening is there is actually quite a lot of backlash (maybe even more than 0.65mm),
but gravity takes it up as long as the gibs are loose enough. Where the gibs are tighter, gravity
doesn't take up the backlash and compensation is required. So I don't know what the answer is,
maybe I need to get better ballscrews/ballnuts?

## Garage

List of things I want to improve about the garage:

 * pedestrian door
 * somewhere to sit
 * desk writing space next to the CNC computer
 * make useful tools more accessible
 * get a better vice (is the Record one better? or what if I just got better jaws?)
 * get a small press, for making press-fits square without having to balance everything in the vice
 * make it clean and tidy
 * permanent station for bandsaw
 * permanent station for (at least one) bench grinder
 * jog pendant for the CNC mill
 * a PC with FreeCAD on it and network access so that I don't have to go back and forth between
   office and garage so much
 * make the CNC router table lower, and make it funnel underneath to a dust bucket
 * new worktop on the island bench
 * keep the angle grinder out and near the vice
 * store drill bits near the pillar drill
 * store cordless drills near the drill bits
 * put pillar drill near lathe?
 * store taps and dies near the vice
 * better chip brush
 * make 4th axis concentric
 * store materials better (currently I have long pipes on the wall, short steel standing upright hard to reach,
   various wood in that box and near the box and in the drawers, small offcuts in blue bins, and small sheet
   stuff in the cardboard box, and some random bits on the bench, and some small lengths in the green crate)
 * fix the power switch on the milling machine
 * get a lathe tool for turning sharp shoulders
 * make a carriage DRO for the lathe
 * work out what to do about Z axis backlash on the milling machine

So what about this plan:

The milling machine moves into the corner, the desk with the CNC PC gets larger to have room
for writing etc., and gets a chair, and has room for legs underneath.

The big workbench gets smaller and lower, and the CNC router gets a "funnel" underneath to direct
dust etc. into a big black crate.

At the end of the big workbench we have the bandsaw and pillar drill and grinder, and a new shelving rack with
drill bits, drills, chargers, taps and dies, etc. on it.

We build a big shelf high up on the wall to move stuff that is currently stored
in stupid places.

I put a new MDF top on the island bench.

Emma said she will touch up the paintwork.

And then remaining things are, for the space:

 * pedestrian door
 * make it clean and tidy
 * store materials better

And for the tools:
 * better vice (or better jaws)
 * jog pendant
 * network access on PC
 * better chip brush
 * make 4th axis concentric
 * fix the power switch
 * lathe tool for sharp shoulders
 * carriage DRO
 * Z axis backlash

I think most important there is working out a way to turn sharp shoulders on the lathe,
and then I can make my pivots on the lathe instead of messing about with the 4th axis, and
I become a lot less bothered by the milling machine issues.

Actually, given that the milling cutter I've been using has a 0.2mm radius anyway, and
that is the same as the lathe tool, I should just be using the lathe already...

## Next

 * make the 1x escapement shafts on the lathe
 * re-fit escape wheel and pinion on metal escapement
 * clamp hairspring to metal escapement frame
 * finish modelling Scotch Yoke escapement, make it
