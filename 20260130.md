## Car front wheels

OK, I revisited this. The reason I couldn't drill the inner spot-face any deeper is because the spot-facing tool was poking through the hole and
hitting the bench! It wasn't fouling on the wheel hub at all.

So they are all spot-faced now.

I only went just deep enough to let it seat all the way around the inner diameter, not the outer diameter, because I didn't want to make it
unnecessarily thin.

## Car rear wheels

I'm making a jig for drilling the holes for the rear wheels. The hole layout, spot-facing, etc. will be the same as the front wheels
but at 100mm PCD instead of 80mm PCD.
