## Sovereign scales

Thinking a bit more about this, here's the way to make them out of aluminium with integrated counterweight:

 * Start with a solid bar, in the vice, on high parallels.
 * With a 6mm end mill, surface the top, cut out the outline down to a depth of just over 3mm, cut out pockets for coins.
 * With a 1mm end mill, cut out the slots.
 * With an engraving tool, engrave the writing, apply chamfers to top if desired.
 * Now flip the part upside down, using some method to reference the horizontal location.
 * With a 6mm end mill, remove the bottom side material, run an outline around the counterweight, and surface off the top of the counterweight.
 * Now flip the part onto its side, using the same method to reference the horizontal location.
 * With a 1.2mm drill, drill the pivot hole.
 * Then manually drill a tiny spot into the counterweight to calibrate it, if required.
