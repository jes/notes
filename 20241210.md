## Datalogging

I've removed the extraneous "id" and "timestamp" fields. "total_micros" is now the
primary key.

Also I noticed the tare wasn't being applied in `data.go`, also fixed now.

## New frame

I should design some bearing holders, or plain pivots, to go no the new frame.

Left one takes the micro ball bearings, right one is a plain pivot. They both put the
shaft 7mm above the mounting surface, so act as drop-in replacements, which will be
handy for working out whether the bearings are an improvement or not.

## TODO

 * make the aluminium frame
 * more gearing stages
 * put sensors in housings
 * make BMP390 work
 * 3d-printed coefficients of friction study
 * low-friction pivots study
 * make the balance shaft thinner so that the pallets can be smaller, and/or machine a gap for the tooth to pass through closer to centre
 * try with the new bearings
 * try out a hollow balance shaft with tensioned wire and plastic bearings, instead of conical pivots
