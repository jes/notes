## Stepper motor clocks

I've installed both of the motors, including little copper wires to earth the cases, and set them both running.

I noticed that the motor on the bamboo clock motor was briefly stopping and restarting, but it seems fine now,
maybe it just needed to wear in its gears a bit.

I noticed that the distance between the first wheel and the motor on the beech clock is too large, I can probably
rememdy this by making the bit that goes on the motor slightly larger.

I've left both clocks running with the first wheel's synchronised, and the flats on the minute hand shafts
roughly synchronised, so that I'll be able to tell if either of them has stopped when I come back later.

Hmm, the bamboo clock is definitely running slower than the beech clock. I wonder if it is missing steps? It is almost
a full revolution behind after only about 15 minutes, which would be about 4 minutes per day.

Both motors stall more easily than I remember, if pressed with a finger. I wonder if the capacitors have got knocked
loose when I was shoving the wires inside the housing? Or if I just have more leverage now that I'm not trying to
grab the shaft directly?

I do have the option to double the voltage if necessary. But I'll leave them running some more and see if they
free up acceptably.

Actually, I'll leave the bamboo one running as-is, and I'll double the voltage on the beech one and see what
difference it makes.

 * does it have more torque? (almost certainly)
 * does it get too hot?

Transformer got very hot, bad smell, motor not turning. OK, so I can't double the output voltage this way.

So the next plan is to put it back to 6.3v, and hook up the oscilloscope to check the phase difference between
the two waveforms.

I put the voltage back, switched it on, still didn't work. Replaced the 3 amp fuse, switched it on, it briefly
worked, but then there was a flash from the transformer and it stopped working. So I think I have broken
this transformer.

I do have a 9v transformer in the drawer though, so I can put that one on and get a bit more voltage out. And
also probe it with the oscilloscope to see if the capacitor is unsuitable.

Ah, the issue with the motor alignment on the beech clock is that the motor is angled downwards because the earth wire pushes
the top of it away from the frame.

I tried to adjust it but not sure how successful I was. Probably I should just print a bigger piece to go on the motor
shaft.

So I'm leaving the beech clock running at 9v to see if it gets unacceptably hot.

This is what the oscilloscope says: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5075

So not a particularly satisfying phase shift. The old one was: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4978

I could try putting a second 47uF capacitor in parallel to see if it is any better. Surprisingly, that makes
it worse! So I need *less* capacitance?

If 9v doesn't get too hot, then I also have a 12v transformer that I can use, and if that doesn't get too hot either
then I can run one on 9v and one on 12v and have them work. Failing that, I can acquire slightly lower-valued capacitors
and run them on 6.3v.

I'm going to install the hands, even though the dials aren't ready, just so I can track their progress.

Both clocks are in sync, with the hands showing the correct time, the first wheels lined up, and the motors
lined up: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5076

 * Bamboo clock: 6.3v
 * Beech clock: 9v

17:03: The bamboo clock is definitely losing time. The beech clock is not getting appreciably warm. I'll leave them both
going a bit longer, but I think 9v is going to be acceptable.
