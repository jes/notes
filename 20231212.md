## Gear cutting

I think today's plan is to make cutters for cycloidal-ish wheels and pinions at module 0.2, and then try to make some
gears, and make a frame to let them mesh together. I should make the frame oversized so that I can add
provision for a mainspring and escapement at a later date.

So what geometry do I need for a cutter for module 0.2 gears?

Stan Bray's "Making Clocks" says that for modules "0.45 to 1.1 to 1.5" the addendum radius should
be 1.93 times the module. He doesn't say how it varies outside this range.

But if that were true, the radius would be 1.93 * 0.2 = 0.386. Which would need a cutter small than
0.8mm to make.

But I don't trust his numbers at all, because for example he says "full tooth depth" is 2.95 times
module for modules 0.45, and 1.1 to 1.5, but is 3.38 times module for modules 0.5 to 1.0. Why the
discontinuity? I think he has badly misunderstood something.

I'll read this [Designing Cycloidal Gears](https://www.csparks.com/watchmaking/CycloidalGears/index.jxl) page.

Oh, skip reading that, he has a [Cycloidal Gear Calculator](https://www.csparks.com/watchmaking/CycloidalGears/CycloidCalculator.html)

Sadly this says the addendum radius is 0.44mm, I certainly don't think I have a 0.8mm cutter that I can cut
steel with. Let's just try and work something out.

Well I tried to use the 0.8mm fibreglass cutting tool and it broke :(. I was trying to use 10mm/min and 0.1mm
depth-of-cut.

However it might have made a workable cutter before it broke! Let's just try and make a gear and see what happens.

I have realised that my "small" fly cutter holder is way too big for watch stuff. It takes 6mm square blanks,
on which I am making cutting tools less than 1mm square. I should make the micro-milling machine.

Before making a gear I should try to harden this cutter. It is O1 tool steel apparently. I think just get it
glowing red and then dunk it in oil. I used the 80W-90 gearbox oil, for no particular reason. I used a plastic
container which was a bad idea as it melted a hole in the bottom, but thankfully the oil didn't escape too
fast.

Well here is my cutter: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5103

For 80 teeth at module 0.2 the addendum is about 0.3mm and the pitch circle is 16mm (according to the csparks
calculator). I have some convenient 16mm stock, so I'll do 77 teeth, which gives a 15.4mm pitch circle, such
that the overall outer diameter is 16mm.

And I'll try to setup the 4th axis concentric. I bumped it around with the drift and it seems within 0.05mm TIR.

I need a better procedure for centering the gear cutter in the Z axis.

## Escapement design

I've read a bit more of Gould, and come across Berthoud's detent escapement:

This looks even simpler than Le Roy's! The impulse pin is beveled on its "back" side
so that on the return swing it lifts the detent arm away from the balance wheel axially.
So the detent arm is its own spring.
