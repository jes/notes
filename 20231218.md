## Spring-driven mechanism

Let's just make a 3d-printed coil-spring mechanism to turn a hand via a basic runaway escapement of some kind.

You can make a spiral in FreeCAD by using "Additive Helix" in "Height-Turns-Growth" mode, and setting height to 0,
with nonzero radial growth.

1. make a coil spring
2. make it live in a frame, with some way to wind it and some way to capture the output
3. make it drive a few gears, with a hand and an escapement

Here's a coil spring: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5123

## Gear-cutting

Resuming with yesterday's gear-cutting...

I've finished cutting the teeth to depth, and parted off 4 discs.

I have a new hypothesis about the angled teeth from the previous time: maybe it is caused by
the parting-off! The parting tool might be putting so much force on the teeth that it bends them
over. So maybe I need to be parting off discs first and then cutting teeth on them.

The tip of the cutter has chipped off again. I think cutting through discs instead of bars would put
less stress on it, so that's definitely the approach to use next time. Also it looks like the tip
of the cutter is angled down slightly, which could easily explain the angle on the teeth.
