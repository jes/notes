## Ruby on rails

Why are we missing body text for some emails?

URL Canary reliably makes emails that appear to have no body.

It's because it was only extracting `mail.text_part`, but that is only applicable
on multipart messages. If it's just a plain-text message, then you need `mail.body`.

And the next thing is if we're drawing the text part, maybe show it pre-formatted
or something?

And auto-link the URLs.

Whoa, actually, ChatGPT tells me that `simple_format` is better than `pre`, looks good.
And for auto-linking the URLs, it tells me that `auto_link` exists, but seems not
available for me.

Apparently was removed, see https://github.com/tenderlove/rails_autolink

I'm using that lib now, works great.

I think `simple_format auto_link foo` is safe, but don't completely understand.
ChatGPT doesn't seem upset by it.

Now what about getting the full names in the To/From fields?

Kind of annoying, the "mail" gem has all this DWIM to separate display names from
email addresses, but that's not *exactly* what I want. For now I am reformatting
it like "Display Name <email@address>". Maybe later I will want to make this reference
Contact objects instead. What if a Contact object has more than one name? Maybe we store
our canonical name in the Contact table, but we also store the name that was in fact used
in the email in an EmailContacts joiner table?

ChatGPT suggests:

    t.references :email, null: false, foreign_key: true
    t.references :contact, null: false, foreign_key: true
    t.string :used_name # name as it appeared in this particular message
    t.string :field     # "from", "to", "cc", etc.
    t.timestamps

for the EmailContacts table.
