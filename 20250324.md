## Meshing

For a first pass, just do straightforward marching cubes in some
fixed volume and save out an STL file.

Then:

 * automatically discover the bounding volume somehow (tracking centres would help, bounding volumes would be better)
 * use a sparse octree, and interval evaluation to quickly discard large empty/full regions
 * something better than marching cubes?

OK, wow, Claude is writing out this entire thing off the top of its head,
including the data tables for marching cubes.

I wonder if it is making mistakes here, or it has memorised the characters
it needs to write, or it recognises the structure of the algorithm so it
is deriving it on-the-fly?

Damn, Anthropic cut it off before it finished.

I pasted what it did and asked it to complete it and it got cut off
early again!

I wonder if they think this is some kind of model abuse?

If I just ask it to add a few lines at a time it is working.

Meh, I'll just copy from https://gist.github.com/dwilliamson/c041e3454a713e58baf6e4f8e5fffecd

First export of default model looks like this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6067

I can *kind of* recognise that this has some triangles in places that
correspond to the default model. It's obviously not working though.

OK, big improvement from mucking about with Cursor:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6068

Can now very clearly recognise the shape, though it still has a few
holes in it.

Looking at just this section: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6069

It is obvious that a lot of the triangles are being placed correctly,
but one of them isn't joining up. So is the triangle table from that
github gist wrong? Or my code is wrong?

ChatGPT suggested logging for "skipping degenerate triangle", and indeed
it is logging a lot of this. So that can easily explain why some triangles
are missing.

At higher resolution we can see it is basically right, just with
holes in it: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6070

It also looks like half of them might have inverted normals.

OK, Claude-3.7-sonnet-thinking has fixed the normals. Still have half
the triangles missing:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6071

By disabling vertex interpolation I get a very blocky mesh that makes
it easier to work out which triangles are missing:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6072

Flat faces perpendicular to X seem to be handled properly. Some
triangles are missing on flat faces perpendicular to Y. All triangles
are missing on flat faces perpendicular to Z.

I gave that description to Claude, and a copy-paste of the comment
from the github gist describing the ordering, and it managed to fix
it:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6073

Great success!

It is truncated because the bounding volume for the voxel evaluation is
too small.

And both binary and ASCII STL exporting seems to be working
correctly.

Gyroid sphere: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6074

The binary STL file for the gyroid sphere is 21 megabytes and it took
about 3 seconds to generate.

I think we could improve on the time spent to generate it by using the
sparse voxel octree thing to cut down on the number of cubes. Probably
wouldn't decrease the file size though, because it genuinely is curved
everywhere. But I probably don't care about the file size.

## First Isoform 3d print

Now that I have meshing, let's print something!

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6077

This is a half-capsule with a shell of a gyroid subtracted from it.
That means it is actually 2 disconnected parts.

Great, worked: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6078

## Node types

I might want to use wrap/unwrap like in https://github.com/jes/stlwrap

Also some way to create text.

How could I create something like a 2d text node or a sketch node, and
then "fit" it to a surface? Maybe you could approximate it with
"Distance Deform Inside"? Extrude your text really far, make sure the
extrusion goes into the surface, and then "Distance Deform Inside" to
make the surface bulge outwards/inwards where the text intersects it?

Kind of a crude tool. Maybe crude tools is just the nature of SDFs.

Also "Pattern along transformed domain". I guess like LinearPattern,
but it somehow references a "Modifer" tree, but the eventual child of
the modifier tree is not an SDF but is just something that captures
the transformed coordinate so that it knows where to place the object.

Still need to figure out the UI for selecting modifier trees.
I think primitives and combinators don't make any sense in this context,
so restricting it to modifiers is correct. I guess you attach
a modifier tree with no eventual leaf primitive, and then somehow
when you evaluate it you just capture out the transformed coordinate.

In fact it's tighter than just modifier nodes: they need to be
*domain* modifying nodes. Some modifiers only modify the distance,
and they would have no effect here. Maybe a way for a node to flag
itself as a domain modifier?

Also, I should make the nodes somehow register themselves somewhere so
that I don't have to explicitly list them all in the UI thing that makes
the context menu.

InvoluteGear (CycloidGear?).

## Rough edges

Where do I want and not want interval arithmetic? I can maybe delete
the GLSL interval code generation, since it is unfinished and probably
not wanted.

Do I want or not want bounding spheres? Either make sure they are all
there and all work correctly, and use them in LinearPattern etc., or
delete them.

Icons in the document tree should probably be images instead of emojis.

Axis display doesn't respect aspect ratio.

Node names should be numbered as small as possible to make them unique,
rather than all going up in number.

Sketch editor should work better.

Save/load your work.

Toggle visibility of selected node with spacebar.

More key shortcuts in general.

Step factor in view toolbar.

Navigation help on a hover popup or something.

Make a "modal" abstraction over the property editor or something, so that
you get to specify more complex inputs and have the properties computed
from them.

Pass the properties into the shader with uniforms instead of recompiling,
where possible.

"Direct modelling" by dragging nodes around the 3d view, or typing
in text boxes overlaid on the 3d view, instead of always typing in the
property editor.

Make some fake abstraction where we classify things at the top level
under Document as "bodies", which are then treated slightly differently
in the UI, but really it's just a union?

Timeline-like version of the tree view? So each operation is either
additive or subtractive, and we build up Union/Subtraction accordingly.

## Prospero challenge

https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/prospero/

This would probably be good practice for working with big arithmetic
expressions, even if I don't actually beat Matt's time.

OK, I wrote a naive implementation in perl just to have somewhere to start, expecting it to be similarly performant to the Python example. But I hadn't recognised that the Python example uses numpy. My perl implementation still hasn't finished running, lol. This challenge is way harder than the page makes it sound!

One idea is to recognise that we only want to know which pixels are
positive and which are negative. What if we start at the end and
work backwards, and turn it into inequalities instead of arithmetic?

So then we get a set of ranges for `x` and `y` in which
the overal expression is less than 0, and then plot those ranges?

For all of the operations:

 * `var-x`<0 if `x<0`
 * `var-y`<0 if `y<0`
 * `const(a)<0` if `a<0`
 * `add(a,b)<0` if `a+b<0`
 * `sub(a,b)<0` if `a-b<0`
 * `mul(a,b)<0` if (`a<0` and `b>0`) or (`a>0` and `b<0`)
 * `max(a,b)<0` if `a<0` and `b<0`
 * `min(a,b)<0` if `a<0` or `b<0`
 * `neg(a)<0` if `a>0`
 * `square(a)` is never less than 0
 * `sqrt(a)` is never less than 0

So actually this all turns into straightforward boolean operations
*except* for add and subtract.

One idea would be to have "only one variable", so let's say we fix
`x` and then we ask for the ranges of `y` for which the expression
is below zero. And then addition and subtraction tell us what values
of `b` give us results below zero as a function of `a`. So for example
`add(5,b)` would give us the interval `b = -inf .. -5`.

But then we'll end up having intervals in both arguments to a future
`add` call, at which point we can't give an answer. Although is
that still fine? If everything is a function of `x`.

Let's say x = 0. For what values of `y` is this function below zero?

    (x+y) * (x-y)

We have:

    _0 var-x
    _1 var-y
    _2 sub _0 _1
    _3 add _0 _1
    _4 mul _2 _3

And then annotating it with the ranges of y for which the result of
that operation is <= zero:

    _0 var-x       y = (-inf .. inf)
    _1 var-y       y = (-inf .. 0)
    _2 sub _0 _1   y = (0 .. inf)
    _3 add _0 _1   y = (-inf .. 0)
    _4 mul _2 _3   y = (-inf .. inf)

So for `x=0` we've proven that this function is <=0 for all `y`.

I actually think this might work. And maybe 2-dimensional ranges are
possible as well? Not clear, because `add(x,y)` would not have
axis-aligned edges for example.

But what if both arguments to `add` are complicated functions of `y`?

Maybe we just brute-force evaluate it for all possible values of `y`,
and then list those exact values for which it evaluates <= 0? Seems
like it's not going to help, we'll be brute-force evaluating almost the
entire tree.

So the 2 ideas I have are:

 * start at the end of the program and work backwards with a set of possible Y values for whatever fixed X value
 * start at the start of program and work forwards tracking which ranges of Y values can give negative answers at each step

The first idea still evaluates almost the entire tree. The second idea
doesn't work because of `add`/`sub`.

So the first is saying "the overall expression will be <0 for these
values of Y", and the second is saying "this specific operation will
be <0 for these values of Y".

Let's imagine a simpler language that only has `var-x`/`const`/`add`/`sub`/`min`/`max`. (No `y`).

How do we make something tell us for which ranges of `x` the
expression is <0? It's easier to make it return an anonymous
function that will tell us whether it is <0 for a particular value
of `x`.

We only need to handle `add(a,b)`, because we define `sub(a,b)` as
`add(a,neg(b))`.

`add(a,b) < 0` if `a < -b`

We can rule out `add` producing a result that is less than 0 if
neither of its operands can produce a result that is less than 0.

It might be more elegant to define `add(a,b) = sub(a,neg(b))`, and

`sub(a,b) < 0` if `a < b`

Maybe we say that for each `y` value for which `a < 0` and
`b > 0`, we propagate that `y` value through to the set of `y` values
for which this expression is below zero. For those where `a > 0` and
`b < 0`, we exclude them, and for ambiguous ones we brute force? And
maybe memoise. (Is there a bottom-up dynamic programming version?).

We'll say that the "range" of y values is 0 to 1023 or whatever,
but the `var-y` node does the mapping to -1 .. +1 space. That way
we're just dealing with integer `y` ranges when we're tracking which
`y` values can give negative results.

Or maybe -512 to +511, so that testing <0 is still easy.

For subtrees that don't depend on `x`, we can keep the memoised result
across all `x` coordinates.

Obviously we also want to do constant folding, and equivalent
subexpression elimination with a DAG or whatever.

I made a start on this in Perl but it is too messy. I should do it in
Go probably. Is there a good Go library for integer Ranges? I think
the data structure I'm looking for is either
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree
or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_tree

## Sketch editor

The sketch editor has somehow become broken. I haven't looked at it in
a while so not sure when. I suspect the commit that made `camera.js`
make use of `Vec3` and `Mat3` broke it, unsure.

Oh! Somehow it works on the default object's sketch, but if you make a new
document and a blank sketch it is broken?

Hmm, no, it's just working properly now. Not sure what was wrong
before.

There are bugs if you try to edit the sketch on the XZ/YZ planes
though.

Also if you disable a sketch node it kind of breaks everything.

Also when you open the sketch the rest of the model disappears.

OK, the model disappearing thing was caused by setting the background
colour on `<canvas>`: need to only do that on `#glCanvas`.

The model getting broken when you disable a sketch is because `noop()`
is `P.const(10000042.0)` instead of actually somehow "disabling"
the object. I wonder how to fix that. When the object is disabled
it should act like it doesn't exist in the tree. But more than that,
when a node returns `this.noop()`, *that* node should act like
it doesn't exist in the tree as well. But that means we don't get to
decide whether a node should act like it exists or not until after we've already decided to evaluate it.

Could we make Peptide have a "noop" operation? It would act like 0 for
adding/subtracting, 1 for multiplying/dividing, infinity for `min()`,
-infinity for `max()`, etc.

Or would it propagate up and turn everything it touches into a noop? And
then you have to check explicitly?

Or we have an `exists()` method in `TreeNode`. And instead of merely
checking whether a child exists in the `children` array, you check
whether `this.children[i].exists()`. And that node can decide whether
it exists or not based on whether its own children exist. And `exists()`
is automatically false when the node is disabled.

And maybe we have 2 different ways to access the "children"? So
one gives you all the children (the current one) and one only gives
you the enabled children?

## Tidying up

I'm actually going to delete the bounding spheres and the exactness
values. They're not rigorously correct, and they're not used for
anything, so they're better off gone.
