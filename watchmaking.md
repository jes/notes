# Watchmaking

List of important unsolved problems:

* how to cut pinions on shafts without crashing the cutter into the collet nut
* how to cut internal teeth on the barrel (**CNC shaping?**)
* how much the mainspring torque will drop as it unwinds (**intuitively, if the mainspring has N turns then the torque should drop by 1/N after the first turn?**)
* whether we want stopwork (**I think yes**)
* how to handle bearings for the barrel (**use the pivots idea in [20231018](20231018.md)**)
* how to make square shoulders on shafts (**use the parting blade??? or use `mk-pivot`, see [4thaxis](4thaxis.md)**)
* how to attach a hairspring (**see the collet idea in [20230921](20230921.md)?**)

My techniques for making watch parts:

## Making gear cutters

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4598

**TODO: try this with silver steel instead of HSS.**

Mount a tool blank in the vice in the milling machine, at a slight angle to provide some clearance (what angle? should I be more thorough about this?).

Model the profile you want to cut in FreeCAD, generate the path, and then edit the path to remove the moves you don't need.

Run the job.

I have done this already with a HSS blank and it worked OK but the machine was not happy cutting HSS. I think next time I should
use silver steel and harden it after cutting.

## Making gears

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4615

[2023-09-08](20230908.md): I made a brass test gear, 33 teeth, module 0.4, 0.75mm thick, 1mm bore.
[2023-11-08](20231108.md): I had a lot of trouble with the gear flicking off
the superglue arbor, suggest cutting teeth before parting off.

Put the brass rod stock in the collet chuck.

Face off the end. Turn to diameter.

Bore the hole in the centre.

Transfer the collet chuck to the milling machine.

Put the gear cutter in the milling machine.

See [4thaxis](4thaxis.md) for how to use `mk-gear` to cut the gear teeth, correcting for concentricity error.

Put the collet chuck back in the lathe and part off.

Cut some grooves in the end of the stock, glue the gear to the grooves,
and face to length.

## Heat treatment

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4791

[2023-10-07](20231007.md): I tried it for the first time, it worked.

[2023-10-08](20231008.md): I did this again, it worked. Very easy process. I also tried bluing a larger part and it worked there too.

Cut off a length of silver steel slightly over the required length. Put it on the
fire brick thing, and prepare a small pot of water and some tweezers. Heat the part with the big blowtorch until bright red,
hold that temperature for a few seconds, and then use the tweezers to plunge it into the water.

Now take it out, sand off the scale, and switch to the smaller blowtorch. Gently apply heat intermittently
until it turns a nice blue colour, and then stop and let it cool down (is it OK to cool it down with water?).

## Making shafts on the lathe

[2023-09-15](20230915.md): I made shafts for a 2x scale escape wheel and balance wheel.

[2023-10-07](20231007.md): I tried to make a shaft for an escape wheel.

(If starting with blued pivot steel, obviously skip the heat treatment).

Put the blued rod in the collet chuck.

Use a right-hand turning tool, with a DCGT (ground) insert, with 0.2mm nose radius if possible.

Turn to the largest diameter.

Use the compound slide to turn a slight taper, if it helps, so that the gear can be hammered on to the required position.

Once the diameter for the gear seat is found, start turning the pivot at the exposed end.

Use the micrometer to measure the diameter, but don't squeeze too hard because it can damage the pivot.

Once the first pivot is in place, use the little ruler to find the required length of the shaft.
Without turning the material around, start turning down the other end pivot. You'll have to leave
a taper where the shoulder should be.

Once the pivot is turned down a bit, "part off" by making a deep-ish groove at the end of the work, and
then break off the shaft by hand.

Take the rod stock out of the chuck, and switch to a collet that suits the most convenient clamping
diameter of the shaft. Use a drill bit or similar if necessary to space out the back of the ER collet.

Now finish turning the other pivot.

If at any point the partially-made shaft bends because the metal is too soft and you took a too-greedy cut,
stop the lathe, manually tap it roughly true using the soft drift, and then start the lathe and push the soft
drift against the spinning part to true it up even more.

## Making pivots on the 4th axis

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4825

[2023-10-13](20231013.md): I made a shaft for the pallet fork, but used the 4th axis in the milling machine instead of the lathe.

[2023-10-14](20231014.md): I used `mk-pivot` to make pivots of the correct size, no taper caused by the endmill shape, and with better concentricity.

Chuck the shaft in the 4th axis.

Zero the axes with X at the very end of the desired pivot, Y and Z on centre line. (Z at midpoint of eccentric centre line).

Measure the runout with a dial indicator.

Input the dial indicator readings into `$high_reading`, `$low_reading`, and `$high_reading_angle` in `mk-pivot`.
Run `mk-pivot` to get G-code. Run the G-code.

## Crossing out

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4625

[2023-09-14](20230914.md): I made an escape wheel using the 1mm end mill.

[2023-10-05](20231005.md): I tried to use the superglue method to cut an escape wheel, and it got flicked off
the glue. It may be better to do the crossing out straight on the end of the bar, before parting off the disc.

Put the parent rod in the collet chuck in the lathe and turn a concentric outer surface, over-size, and maybe drill the shaft
hole.

Transfer the collet chuck to the CNC router, centre on the outer diameter, cut the crossing-out. Drill the shaft hole on the
CNC router if not done on the lathe.

Back to the lathe, part off the crossed-out disc, ready to glue on the superglue arbor for cutting teeth.

See [micromachining](micromachining.md) for more.

## Fitting gears to shafts

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4631

[2023-09-15](20230915.md): I fitted shafts to the 2x scale escape wheel and balance wheel.

[2023-10-13](20231013.md): I fitted shaft and pins to the pallet fork.

**TODO: I probably want some improved staking tools.**

Use a tapered reamer to slightly open up the hole, if the hole was drilled under-sized, which it should have been.

Put the gear on a flat surface with a hole in the middle.

Slide the shaft into the hole as far as it can go.

Hammer the shaft home.

If the pivot bent in this process, put the shaft (with gear) back in the lathe, and try to true it up using the
soft drift. This is less likely to happen if using hardened shafts and proper staking tools.

If the gear is loose on the shaft, use Loctite 603 to secure it.

## Making a die block

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4633

[2023-09-16](20230916.md): I made this first pass at an aluminium die block.

**TODO: I haven't tried the following process.**

Start with a soft material (probably aluminium). If you try to use tool steel you are in
for a [world of pain](20230916.md).

Work out which hole diameters you want and what spacing you want.

Cut a piece of (without loss of generality) aluminium roughly to size.

Mount it in the milling machine and setup your coordinate system.

Drill counter-bores (maybe 3-5mm?) in the location of each hole, stopping short of the full thickness
of the material (maybe 1mm or 2mm short).

Flip the work over (or, if all the drills are long enough, don't even bother flipping it over).

Now drill the actual holes in their required locations, but importantly the holes are only 1-2mm deep,
which makes it unlikely that the drills will break.

Now take the metal out of the milling machine and draw-file the surfaces.

## Making pivot holes

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4634

[2023-09-17](20230917.md): I made these frame parts for the metal escapement prototype.

I just used the 1mm PCB drill and made straight holes. They worked plenty well enough, no need for
tapered reaming. I expect the same process would work with the 0.5mm PCB drill. And having straight
pivot holes means they won't wear out so quickly.

One of the shaft pivots was slightly over-sized so it wouldn't fit in the hole. I enlarged the hole
using a 1.1mm drill in the pin vice.

I also manually
used a larger drill in the pin vice to make tiny countersinks on the back side for oil cups, I don't
know if they do any good though.

* "Horosilv", a pot of 120g for Â£40, you rub it on brass and it silver-plates it, maybe good for the dial.
* "Rub N Brite", a metal polish that leaves a coating of wax to protect the mirror finish.
