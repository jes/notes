## Workbench

I cut the notches for the lower leg bracing pieces,
and glued and screwed everything together.

The bench is square as measured across the diagonals, which is good, but the
joints are not very tight. I may pour some extra glue into the joints.

Also the top is not a very flat plane, some parts of it stick up, so I will
have to somehow flatten the top surface of the frame before I put the top on.

Progress though.
