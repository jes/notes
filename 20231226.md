## Thin barrel

Improvements required were:

 * better way to retain the hook on the shaft
 * better way to retain the hook on the outside of the barrel
 * more clearance for the 0.35mm piano wire spring
 * some method to clamp the barrel together

For a next pass I reckon machine the parts on the router.

The lower piece will have a 0.6mm deep step around the outside for the upper piece
to snap into, and there will be 0.4mm depth for the piano wire.

The hook onto the arbor can stay as it is for now, but the hook at the outside will be a
feature machined into the outside of the lower piece.

Looks reasonably sensible, but FreeCAD decided to put a big gouge right through
the bottom of it: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5157

And I think Z=0 was too low.

So now this needs a hook on the outside, and then cutting out.

I cocked up the Z zero again on the hook:

I referenced it to the bottom surface of the barrel, but set that as Z=0 instead of Z=-1.

I'm quite impressed that the tool didn't break.

Not very good. It is 1.7mm thick on one side and 1.5mm on the other, so the table was
pretty far out of level. Also the register that the cap is meant to click into is not
very round, obviously the hook went all the way through instead of only down to the bottom
surface, there is a gouge in the bottom.
