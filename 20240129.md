## Odd jobs

Just odd jobs today:

 * Lidl shop
 * took the kitchen door hinges off, stripped all the paint, lacquered, refitted
 * lubricated the door handles and hinges on the car
 * wanted to spray expanding foam in the gap in the corner of the conservatory, but found
   that none of my bottles were working, have ordered a new one, I think the cold weather
   over winter may have ruined them
