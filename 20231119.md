## 1x plastic escapement

I'm reprinting the broken parts.

## Garage

I'm going to start rearranging stuff, in particular I want to get the milling machine into its new position.

I must remember to fix the roof leaks.

OK, I've took all the stuff off the shelf in the back left corner, and dusted off the shelf and moved
it next to the pillar drill, dusted off the walls and swept the floor and vacuumed the cobwebs off the
ceiling in that corner, and moved the milling machine into its new position.

Control cabinet moved, and everything plugged in and working: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5024

I think the desk is only temporary, because I want it slightly bigger, and I want to be able to sit
on a chair and have my legs underneath.

I switched the power wiring over to the other switch, and it has the same problem as the first! So annoying. It switches on but won't switch off. I think the problem is caused by overheating it when soldering the wires on, but I was really careful not to get it too hot this time.

Thinking about the milling machine, I wonder if I would actually
get more repeatable results with Z axis backlash compensation
turned off, on the basis that once it settles into a cut gravity
will do the work of always positioning it in the same place, and
it's only the dial indicator that notices the backlash?

## Escapement design

The "practical course in horology" book says (page 101) that the escapement should be "banked to the drop",
i.e. the limit of motion of the lever should be just beyond what is required to allow the teeth
to escape. In my escapement the banking is much further than this, maybe I should remedy that.

Principles it has are:

 * banking to the drop
 * "a drop lock of 2 to 3 degrees is allowed for wristwatches" - I think this is how much the
   escape wheel has to recoil to unlock
 * "the lever should move an equal distance on either side of the line of centres" - not sure whether
   this is achievable with my design, hard to think
 * "A draw of 12 degrees is considered sufficient by most horologists" - this is the angle that pulls
   it into the lock, relative to a neutral angle that neither pushes nor pulls
 * "the drop should be equal" - by what angle does the escape wheel rotate between unlocking one
   pallet and landing on the next one? should be the same for both
 * "the total angular motion of the lever [is] 10 degrees" which is comprised of 8.5 degrees lift,
   and 1.5 degrees drop lock (contradicting the previously recommended 2 to 3 degrees of drop lock...)

So let's measure mine (in CAD).

 * banking to the drop: the pallet fork is about **4 degrees away** from the drop when banked on the receiving pallet
   and **3 degrees away** when banked on the discharging pallet.
 * drop lock of 2 to 3 degrees: mine is about **0.6 degrees** when unlocking the receiving pallet, and about
   **0.4 degrees** unlocking the discharging pallet.
 * draw of 12 degrees: mine looks to be about **21 degrees** on the receiving pallet and **21 degrees** on the discharging pallet.
 * drop should be equal: **5.2 degrees** when dropping from the receiving pallet, **3.6 degrees** from the discharging pallet.
 * total angular motion of the lever is 10 degrees: mine is **18.5 degrees**.

So:

 * the distance between leaving the impulse face on one pallet and getting fully banked with the other pallet is too far.
 * the recoil when unlocking is not enough
 * the draw is too much
 * the drop is unequal
 * the total angular motion of the lever is too much

Possible remedies are:

 * make the impulse face steeper (but still leave the impulse face at the same "length", in terms of escape wheel angle), to make it bank closer to the drop
 * make the lever longer, or move the impulse pin closer to the centre of the balance wheel, to reduce total angular motion

And I don't know how I can decrease the draw angle but also increase the drop lock. Maybe this is just a geometrical problem
with using pins for pallets?

I'm not really inclined to make the impulse face steeper, feels like it will cause more friction. But I think I do
want it "banked to the drop". Maybe I just need to increase the size of the escape wheel, but leave all the angles
the same?
