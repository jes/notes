## Resting-wheel verge escapement

The plan is to make a version of:

to put on the test frame, and see how it goes compared to the previous versions I've tried.

And then stop messing about with the escapement and build the rest of the clock!

I think reduce the resting radius further, and make the escape wheel smaller
accordingly. (Later on, could increase the number of teeth, but better to compare
like with like for now).

Also I've put some washers on the second shaft bracket to increase the depthing slightly.
From spinning it by hand I noticed that the tooth tips are catching on the rollers as they
come into engagement.

This is looking really good.

### Initial test

So here (after the initial ramp up while the amplitude is reaching a steady state), every
data point is within a range of about **6 milliseconds**. The previous best was 16 milliseconds,
so this is a lot better.

Also, I'm only running this on 3x M20 nuts for a drive weight and the amplitude is over 200
degrees.

We see a very clear cycle with a period of about 78 seconds, so that will be the rotation
of the escape wheel.

The period is getting much closer to the 2.12 seconds that I previously noted was the natural
frequency of the balance, so that's good.

I also have a new feature in clockwatcher:

74 samples is one rotation of the escape wheel, so this completely averages out the variation
throughout the escape wheel rotation.

And the amplitude vs period plot looks pretty linear! After the initial ramp-up period.

And running faster in the longer arcs.

The period *averaged over a full rotation of the escape wheel* stays within 3 milliseconds
here.

Scrolling the moving average up/down and looking at the amplitude/period plot is a good way
to find the variation period! If the number of samples is not synced to the variation
period then you get loops in it:

Which are minimised when your moving average size matches the variation period, which in this
case indeed minimises the loops at 74 samples.

Also one of the pallets is catching on the escape wheel teeth as it swings back towards
it. It is making a "tick... ta-tock" sound. So I should move the escape wheel slightly
further away. Also keen to try with more drive weight. And maybe try to
make the balance shaft more perpendicular to the escape wheel shaft.

### After some adjustment

OK, I have improved the depthing and straightened up the balance shaft.

The escape wheel is showing a slight recoil just before escaping from the upper pallet.
I think perhaps the resting surface is slightly bulbous near the corner?

This is even better. The averaged period is within **0.6 milliseconds** over a 25-minute
run. And the absolute period is within 2 milliseconds.

The period seems to be trending down over time, perhaps because it is night time and the
heating has gone off, so the room is getting cooler? I should add temperature monitoring.

It would be good to get a trace of it running over an entire day or so to see how it varies
throughout the day. Need more gearing for that.

I have a suspicion that some of the variation is from the tension in the winding of the
string, and the snaking of the string across the winding drum. I should put a helical groove
in the winding drum so that it doesn't snake, and add some sort of winding ratchet so that
I can keep consistent tension. And maybe replace the cotton string with fishing line or
something.

### More drive weight

Now I'm going to go up from 3x M20 nuts to 6x, like before, and see how it performs.

If you ignore the first ~78s worth of data (because that's not averaged over the full 74 samples)
then we're within 0.3 milliseconds over almost 20 minutes, and the amplitude is up to about
285 degrees.

### Balance spring adjustment

I adjusted the balance spring so that it was closer to taking exactly the weight
of the balance. Still running with 6 nuts.

The amplitude is up to maybe 305 degrees, but it is occasionally skipping teeth and the
period stability is much worse.

I tried to adjust the depthing to fix the teeth skipping, but I can't
get it to work. I think the balance shaft perpendicularity is out again. This can move
every time I adjust the pivots if the pivots aren't properly concentric. I probably want
independent adjustment of the pivot location and height. I.e. like it is now, but in
a separate piece that can slide around on its mounting holes slightly, so you set the
height of the pivot, and then with that fixed in place you can move it around to adjust
the upper and lower depthin independently.

## TODO

 * retry with more balance weight now that I can adjust the spring indepdent of the pallets
 * add temperature and pressure monitoring (and air density?)
 * add another secondary shaft, increase ratio of existing shaft
 * make shaft depthing adjustable
 * make balance pivots adjustable in X/Y plane
 * experiment with pallet angles
 * data logging to a file, and view historical data, zoomed to different time ranges
 * make the barrel allow winding with a ratchet or something, and put a helix on it
 * replace cotton string with fishing line?
 * experiment with interpolating datapoints to get higher precision angles?
 * make the "averaged" charts ignore the first N datapoints, that don't have enough to average over?
