## Slot in wheel

I think the idea of putting the slot in the wheel instead of the lever is not going to work.

I've been playing with configurations like this in FreeCAD:

It always seems like the pin can easily get stuck the "wrong" side of the notch in the slot.

I mean, it would work if the slot was just a vertical slot (like it is when it is in the lever), but
then we don't gain any amplitude freedom.

I've left this in `lever-escapement-prototype4.FCStd`, but I'm not going to bother printing it.

## Guard dart

So the next idea is probably to think of a simple way to make the "guard dart" system.

I've copied `lever-escapement-prototype3.FCStd` to `lever-escapement-prototype5.FCStd` and will
work on it in there.

Actually, before that, what if I just cut the top limit off the slot in the one I have? I want to
see it working (and exhibiting banking behaviour) before I bother CAD'ing the guard system.

Yeah, it works, as expected:

Although the bolts crash into the balance wheel pivot very soon after the pin exits the slot.
Must remember to reduce the diameter of the balance wheel to accommodate the heads of the bolts!

What if I take the last bolts out? How much amplitude can I actually get?

175 degrees, not bad! Pretty bad beat error though, I think there are not enough turns on the
spring so we're into plastic deformation again.

So the plan is:

* remove the top of the slot
* make a guard feature
* reduce the balance wheel diameter to allow clearance for bolt heads
* make a spring with an extra turn
