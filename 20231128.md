## Continuous remontoire

The Harrison clocks all have remontoires that rewind periodically, getting more frequent as they get more advanced.

Instead of a periodic rewinding, why not have the remontoire be completely continuous? I.e. it is a component
that passes torque only up to a given limit.

You could imagine providing torque via a torsion bar, so that as more torque is applied, the bar twists more.
Then you have a sliding piece keyed to one end of the bar, with "axial cams" on a disc at the other end of the bar,
so that as the bar twists, it pushes the sliding piece axially, and you'd have the sliding piece operate a brake
on the input, so that the input is braked proportionally to its torque.

Does that get you a constant torque output, or does the output still increase as the input increases? It feels like
the latter to me, but maybe it is adjacent to an actual solution.

## Stepper motor clock

I cut away part of the spacer that was interfering with the second wheel and it all works really well now:

So I'm going to start printing parts for the other clock, except I'll have 2 copies of the shortest spacer and none
of the mid-sized one.

Both frames assembled, and with one coat of lacquer, and 2 coats of white paint on the blanks for the dials: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5063

I've also got the second clock's gears all installed on shafts, just the electrical cover printing and then
that's all the printing done for that one.

So, tomorrow:

 * print a set of hands in black and see if I'm satisfied with them, print the other set if so
 * check the lacquering of the frames, do more if necessary, allow to dry
 * do updated CAM for the dials
 * engrave the dials, spray black, wipe off, allow to dry
 * fit dial feet to frames
 * install all gears and check for free running
 * make up the 2nd cable
 * make up both motor plugs (how?)
 * install all the electrics and screw the covers on
 * cut out the dials, don't forget the countersunk screw holes! (sink until 6mm cutter is below surface)

## Milling machine

I wanted to cut the flat on the third wheel shaft for the second clock, but when I went to use the milling
machine the Z axis motor was broken again! It just moves a tiny amount and then trips the alarm, as if the
servo feedback isn't working.

I tried hitting it with a hammer again but it didn't help.

I solved my immediate problem by unplugging the cables for the Z axis motor and turning it manually, to position
the head for cutting the flat on the shaft, which has worked, but I'd really like this machine to work
properly.

Well I took the motor off again, took it partially apart, and it started working. I don't know what changed.

To save me the trouble of having to undo the bolts from the bottom, I have tapped M6 threads in the motor housing,
and drilled out the holes at the top of the Z axis, so now it bolts on from above, much more convenient.

I have a theory about what was wrong: I think it might be caused by the backlash compensation. I had 0.35mm
configured for the Z axis, and maybe when the motor is cold the backlash compensation makes it try to accelerate too
fast? Or, maybe the issue is just that Z acceleration is set too high? Not sure. It's working again for now
anyway.
