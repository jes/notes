## Storm Darragh

This is the plot of pressure over time:

Reached a minimum of about 983 hPa at about 4.45am. Not sure why there is more jitter
between the minimum and midday. Wind??

The wind blew down some of the fences in the night, annoying.

## Weight pulley

And twice as many weight nuts, modulo the allen key.

The frame is noticeably splayed apart but it still seems to run so I'll just see how it
goes for 3 (?) hours. The balance pivots are very loose.

Aargh, I accidentally refreshed the clockwatcher page and lost all the data. I rewound
it and started it again.

Definitely need to work on storing the data persistently.

I don't know what happened just before 1000 seconds. Best guess is that the drive weight is
too marginal and the remontoire didn't rewind, but then at 1150 seconds or so it did.

At about 10500 seconds I came back to the
office and noticed that the slotted disc
was intermittently scraping the encoder
housing. It's not obvious that it has made
a significant difference to how the clock
runs though. I speculate that it is caused
by the drive weight moving further back and
increasing the torque that is splaying the
frame open.

It stopped after about 11000 seconds (just
over 3 hours), the
remontoire having failed to rewind.

From about 5000 seconds onwards, there
was a gradual decrease in amplitude and
increase in period. Is this when the slotted
disc started rubbing?

I think I'd want to re-adjust the balance
pivots to accommodate the extra weight,
add maybe 1 more nut to make sure the remontoire
always rewinds, and make sure it is not
rubbing the slotted disc.

## Position/velocity plot

I'm going to ask Cursor what to do about the position and velocity data getting out
of sync.

Actually I think I'm wrong about it getting out of sync. It looks like `addReading()`
always adds a velocity value if it added a position value, so I don't see why they'd get
out of sync.

And in fact I can see the velocity plot kind of pulsating, but although the timestamps on the
x axis are scrolling from right to left, the data in the plot is staying basically still.

Meh, this is too annoying, and I don't even really care about this plot. I'll just delete
the plot.

## John Harrison's Contrivance

I am going to concatenate the 3 PDFs into one, and then get some quotes for printing
as a book.

`$ pdfunite 1.pdf 2.pdf 3.pdf output.pdf`

And my OCD requires me to edit out the text "Printed by Copytech (UK) Ltd".

I tried opening it in LibreOffice Draw, but it messed up all the formatting.

Inkscape loads it up successfully. I can't easily edit the text, but I can draw a white
rectangle over it. The export tool can't save as PDF, but I can "Print to file" to get a PDF.

It seems like the "print to file" tool in the Inkscape snap doesn't have permission to save
to a file. I can't find anywhere that it does
have permission to write to. (Update: it is
just slow; the files did arrive eventually).

Apparently you have to use "Save a copy" to
export a PDF, that has worked.

But somehow the Inkscape-exported one is 100
megabytes instead of 3 megabytes. I'll use the
Adobe tool to shrink it.

Lol, only reduced it to 84 megabytes, oh well.
But the image quality is ruined.

Seems like you should be able to draw a
rectangle over a PDF without really
changing it at all.

Next up is the Adobe "Sign your PDF" tool.
ChatGPT says you can use that to draw boxes
over things. Adobe want me to sign in with
Apple or Google, no thanks.

Apparently "Okular" has a way to redact
information from a PDF, let's try that.

It draws your "highlight" behind the text,
but making a black highlight is good
enough to redact it.

Good, that's done the job, and I now have
the full book as a single PDF, with "Printed by"
redacted, and it is only 12MB.

It's Â£23 from PrintPond, A4, black and white,
bound with a "metal channel".

## Boiler

The boiler is having trouble meeting the target
flow temperature.

The target is 60 deg. C and it is basically
throttling down to minimum at 30 deg. C,
so the radiators are not getting very warm.

This has been an issue in the past and I
never solved it.

I think the issue is the difference between
the outgoing temperature and the return
temperature.

We have one radiator removed at the moment
for decorating, so maybe there isn't enough
flow through the system and the water is
coming back still hot?

I reduced the target temperature to 45 deg. C
and it seems to be doing a better job of
meeting it now.

Must remember to put it back up once the
removed radiator is back on.

## Clock

I was thinking that instead of using conical pivots, I could have a steel wire pulled tight
running from top to bottom through a hollow balance wheel,
and PTFE bearings at the ends. This is similar to the balance suspension in my grandad's
clock.

## TODO

 * more gearing stages
 * design the frame
 * store all datalogging persistently, and allow viewing static data from some specified time window
 * put sensors in housings
 * 3d-printed coefficients of friction study
 * low-friction pivots study
 * make the balance shaft thinner so that the pallets can be smaller, and/or machine a gap for the tooth to pass through closer to centre
 * try again with better adjusted pivots, more balance weight
