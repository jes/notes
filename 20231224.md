## Thin barrel, direct-drive hands

I kind of subconsciously discarded this idea the other day, but it might be easier to make the "thin barrel"
with much stiffer wire, and make it turn only once every 12 hours, and have the hand driven directly off
the barrel arbor, instead of having the 24x reduction thing on top.

That one works out to about 17600 bph, so obviously a workable
arrangement. It does have some 6-leaf pinions but if they became
8-leaf it would still be about 10000 bph.

Total gears: **8**

Pros:

 * minimises the number of gears required
 * driving the hand is trivial

Cons:

 * only works if stiff thin mainspring is possible

I think this is strictly an improvement over the "hollow barrel".
It has all the same pros and much fewer cons.

But I would move the thin barrel so that it sits between the movement and the dial, with
both of the movement plates beneath it. The barrel arbor will run all the way down to the
lower plate so I think it will be well supported, and that's the only piece that turns.
It's OK if turning the barrel itself has a lot of friction because that will only be done
by hand when winding.

## Thin barrel

Next up on making the thin barrel is machining the slot for poking in the wire, and drilling
the hole to hook it on.

And testing with a piece of the wire, it looks like the depth is about right, which is good.

I extended the slit down into the surface of the disc slightly to give some more space for the
bend radius.

So now I just need a brass disc for the end cap, and then a shaft for the middle.

Here's an end cap: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5149

Made using the superglue arbor, might have been quicker to use the CNC router, not sure.

I've been trying to work out how to keep the 2 parts of the barrel pressed together so that the spring
can't overlap itself. Ideas include:

 * tap the outside of one piece and put 3x M1.6 screws in
 * cross-drill the shaft and put pins through to stop the caps separating
 * cross-drill the shaft on one end only, and have a step on the shaft on the other end
 * have a step on the shaft on the upper end and butt against a raised boss on the movement top plate on the lower side

Maybe for now I'll just forget about it and use clamps. So for now I just need a single ~0.4mm cross-drilled hole
in a shaft. I'll make the shaft 2mm and drill the barrel holes out to 2mm.

To do the cross-drill I held the rod in the collet chuck in the 4th axis, packed underneath the rod with wood,
machined a small flat with the 1mm end mill, and then drilled straight down slowly with a 0.4mm PCB drill.
Seems to have worked:

Now to try to assemble it and wind the mainspring.
