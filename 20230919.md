## Roof

Plan today:

* block off the "rafters" (?)
* put strips up to space the plasterboard away from the aluminium (will I need longer screws?)
* silicone the gutter
* silicone against the wall if it's dry enough
* put insulation up
* post Paul's coin (maybe include a £2 pacman if there's time)

I put up the OSB rafter-blocker pieces while Emma and Lucy were at Tiny Talks,
and got most of the insulation done.

Did the rest after they got back:

It didn't take as long as expected, although it was very annoying that the insulation that was sold
as "width: 1200mm" was actually a wide piece and a short piece packaged together. That would obviously
be fine if you were just jamming it in the floor of a loft, but very annoying for trying to hold
it up in a ceiling.

First piece of plasterboard is up:

We cut it in half because it was too heavy. The answer is yes I will need longer screws, ordered on Amazon,
coming tomorrow.

So I've done all of the planned roof stuff except the siliconing, because it's been too wet.

## Escapement video

The metal esacpement video has had over 1000 views on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndS-ELGlqVc

Seems surprising. I had a look in YouTube analytics...

Lol, what? I'm guessing the time icon next to "Unique viewers" means it is old data. It says
95% of viewers found it on "YouTube recommendations" on the YouTube home page.

## Pacman £2 coin

Paul asked about making a cut-away £2 coin ("like a sort of wide-mouthed pac-man") to show how
the inner and outer are joined together, so let's try and do that...

Great success. I've stuck both this coin and the fake clipped planchet in the post to Paul.

## Baby walker

The baby walker wants some scrap metal in the bottom to weight it down, and then some wood on top
of the metal to stop Lucy grabbing the metal.

Instead of scrap metal, I filled it with stones. There is an M20 nut in each corner acting as a spacer,
and an M8 nut and bolt holding the top down. The top is a piece of 5mm plywood left over from the
Egyptian coin box project. It turns out the bottom of the walker is only about 3mm thick, and in tightening
up the bolts I have managed to crack it, never mind. It's more stable for her which is what matters.

## Lever escapement

I realised that I can put the old balance wheel in place of the lever on the new frame and see if the
pins interact with the escape wheel correctly. So let's try that and see what is going on...

Update: no I can't, because the balance wheel doesn't fit between the pillars of the frame. Sigh.

But I took a video of the lever moving back and forth by the minimum amount, which I [20230917.md](previously said)
was +/- 6 degrees, or 12 degrees total.

What do we see by comparing the video frames?

Only about 5 degrees in total. So this definitely doesn't match the CAD.

Oh, but I could put the *old* frame back together and put the lever in that one to see how it behaves there!
That could rule out the new frame as the source of the error.

First impressions upon holding the old frame together and playing with it:

* the pivots on the old frame have *much* less friction
* the lever does actually seem to be moving further on the old frame, not yet clear whether this is purely due to the reduced friction

## Tomorrow

* plasterboarding
* siliconing
* lever escapement
