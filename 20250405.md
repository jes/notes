## Targeted blends

I think I'm satisfied enough with the idea that Combinators jump on
top of Modifiers when the tree needs rewriting. Just keep it to a minimum,
only do it when there are targeted blends that require it.

And the method is something like:

Clone the tree, keeping `uniqueId` intact.

Label each node with the set of surface ids it can yield.

Nodes are either:

 * combinator: more than one child & has "isCombinator" true or something: can yield any of the surface ids its children can yield
 * modifier: has at least 1 child but is not a combinator: yields the surface id of its first child
 * primitive: yields its own `uniqueId` as a surface id

Blends only apply at combinators. (For now: but eventually we will
want an abstraction over "surfaces" so that LinearPattern etc. can give
a different surface id to each surface of each copy).

Now iterate over combinators starting from the ones furthest from the
root.

So then at each combinator, look at the set of surface ids you can get
from the left child, and for each one look at the set of surface ids you
can get from the right child.

Say left is `(1,2,3)` and right is `(4,5)`.

Now look up the targeted blends for each of those ids, and see if the
other surface of the targeted blend is on the other child of the
combinator. If so, rewriting not needed here.

Then build up the set of all possible pairs of surface id.

    { (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5) }

Now look up blend parameters for each of these pairs. If so,
rewriting not needed here.

(Also, if we eventually get a `Link` node then either `Link` ought to
yield new surface ids, or else instead of checking that all of the blend
arguments are contained as children, we need to check that none of the
blend arguments are *not* contained as children. Because there will
be duplicate ids in the tree.)

Now in the 2 places that we said "If so, rewriting not needed here"...
If not, work out how to do the rewriting?

If the node does not contain all of its blend arguments, then the node
needs to be moved up the tree. Without loss of generality, everything
above a Combinator is also a Combinator.

So we transform like so:

    C1(C2(a,b), c)

Where C1,C2 are combinators and A,B,C are arbitrary subtrees. Let's say
we want a blend between A and C. So now C2 doesn't have all its blend
arguments as children, so C2 needs to move up.

We rewrite to:

    C2(C1(a, c), C1(b, c))

So if we had:

    C1: parent=null, left=C2, right=c
    C2: parent=C1, left=a, right=b

We now change to:

    C1a: parent=C2, left=a, right=c
    C1b: parent=C2, left=b, right=c
    C2: parent=null, left=C1a, right=C1b

So if C2 is the left argument of C1, and we grab out C1's right argument
X, then for our children A,B, we replace them with C1(A,X),C1(B,X) and
then delete our parent and reparent ourselves to its parent.

So that's the method for rewriting to make sure the combinator
contains all its blend arguments.

In the event that the immediate parent of C1 is not a combinator, we instead
take the Modifier chain that sits between C1 and C2, and push it
down to be on top of C2's children.

So:

    C1(M(C2(a,b), c))

becomes:

    C2(C1(M(a), c), C1(M(b), c))

And if that still doesn't get you all of the blend arguments as
children, then move C2 up another level, etc.

And then once we have all the blend arguments as children, we have the
issue if not all the blend parameters are the same.

Let's say we have:

    C(a, b)

Where a,b are subtrees that can yield (1,2,3) and (4,5) as surface ids,
and we only want a blend between 1 and 4.

For a subtree to be able to yield more than one id its root must be a
Combinator (without loss of generality).

Actually I think this case would be solved automatically. Because
for there to be a blend between 1 and 4, there must be a child
that yields 1 and a child that yields 4. And earlier on when we reached
the child that yields 1 we would have noticed that its blend argument
4 was not present, and rewrote the tree to fix it.

So... is that enough?

Probably I do test-driven development for this.

So we take in a tree of `TreeNode`s, and a set of blends, and give
a rewritten version of the tree where every Combinator has the same
blend parameters regardless of what comes out of its child nodes, and
then compile the rewritten tree into our SDF.

Could the rewriting be done as part of the `peptide()` function? Not
obviously straightforward.

I guess what I'm struggling with is the fact that `peptide()` seems to
be defined for any `TreeNode`, without regard for the requirement that
the Combinators have consistent blend params.

So maybe `blendParams()` throws an error if that is not satisfied? And
then it's only safe to call `peptide()` on a rewritten tree.

Should `peptide()` take the array of children as an argument? And then
we can change which children we give to which nodes without having to
clone the nodes. No, because those children in turn will have children.

Maybe cloning the tree is not a problem.

And what do we call the operation of rewriting the tree to make blends
work?

Another issue is that my Combinators can have more than 2 children.
So I think first the Combinators need rewriting into a form that only
has 2 children.

I wonder if instead of rewriting the complete tree, we instead have
some intermediate step between the `TreeNode` and the `peptide()` call,
that returns a "good" tree.

Like a `normalised()` or something, that by construction returns a tree
where all the Combinators have static blend parameters.

To start with just make `normalised()` break up Combinators so they
always have 2 children.

Then maybe rewrite the complete "normalised" tree afterwards.

OK, we'll turn the "normalised" tree into a simpler tree representation
that just has:

 * combinator: 2 children
 * modifier chain: 1 child
 * primitive: 0 children

and each node has a reference to the original `TreeNode`(s).

Tests:

 * does `normalised()` work?
 * does `possibleSurfaceIds()` work?
 * does `fromTreeNode()` work?

Adding a test for `normalised()`, it should turn:

    Union(Subtraction(Sphere,Sphere,Box),
          Intersection(Sphere,Box,Gyroid),
          Union(Sphere,Box,Box))

into:

    Union(Union(Intersection(Intersection(Sphere, Negate(Sphere)), Negate(Box)),
                Intersection(Intersection(Sphere, Box), Gyroid)),
                Union(Union(Sphere, Box), Box))

So 19 nodes in total. But I'm only seeing 12. The first discrepancy
is that `Subtraction(Sphere,Sphere,Box)` has only turned into
`Intersection(Sphere, Negate(Sphere))`, i.e. it's no longer subtracting
the Box.

In fact all of them only get the first 2 arguments instead of all 3,
apart from the top-level Union which seems to be working correctly.

So `normalised()` is not working properly.

It was because constructing a new node with some given children also
deletes those children from their previous parent! So do it by
iterating over a copy of `this.children` instead.

And `normalised()` also is not preserving `possibleSurfaceIds()`
values.

Oh, lol, I had 2 implementations of `clone()` - one that rewrote
`uniqueId` and one that did not, I renamed the latter now.

So `normalised()` and `possibleSurfaceIds()` are looking good now.

Next up is whether `TreeRewriter.fromTreeNode()` is making
correct-looking intermediate trees?

So, make some complicated tree structure, call `fromTreeNode()` on it,
and check that it is going through `cloneWithSameIds()` and `normalised()`,
and that modifier chains are collapsing into single nodes, and that
the `uniqueId` of the leaf nodes is unchanged.

Then we get on to actually rewriting the tree.

OK, `fromTreeNode()` looks good. Let's actually make sure `toTreeNode()`
can correctly reconstruct a tree.

Good, working now.

So to test rewriting a tree, the basic case is if we don't ask for
any blends, you have to produce a tree that is equivalent to the
input tree.

And then if we want multiple blends but they are already satisfied by
the input tree, make it still equivalent.

And then if we ask for a single blend that requires a simple rewrite,
with no modifier chains, and only one level of applying distributivity,
it should handle that.

And then do a big complicated test.

The trivial cases are obviously passing without having to implement
`rewriteTree()`. So now on to the "simple blend" case.

We have:

    Union(Intersection(Sphere, Gyroid), Box)

with a blend between Sphere and Box, so we need to rewrite to:

    Intersection(Union(Sphere, Box), Union(Gyroid, Box))

Currently it is not quite working because when we duplicate `Box` in
the tree we can't set its parent pointer.

So steps are:

 * work out what to do about parent pointers when duplicating node references
 * distribute over right child as well as left child
 * provide `satisfiedBlends()` to decide whether the node is good or not
 * add more tests
