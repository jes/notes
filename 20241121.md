## Clock

Ideas to try were:

 * increase the drive weight until the amplitude matches what we had before, about 260 deg.
 * use a lantern pinion and see if that reduces the period variation
 * see how much difference adding weight to the balance wheel makes to the period variation
 * see if the new rods and bearings make any difference (do we get more amplitude for the same drive weight? hope so)
 * reduce the radius of the resting surface and see what happens

### Adding more drive weight

Let's try 6 nuts.

About 205 deg. average amplitude. Definitely getting into frictional rest,
but the period variation
is still dominated by the fluctuating drive torque due to the gears meshing.

I tried putting oil on the teeth of the meshing gears but it didn't produce any observable
effect.

### Adding weights to the balance

The idea is this will increase the *dominion* of the balance over the train.

The downside is it will put more weight on the bottom pivot, so increase the friction
of the balance. And we would probably want a stronger balance spring to suit the
heavier balance.

I've put 2x M12 bolts on the balance wheel.

It's not running with enough amplitude to enter frictional rest even with 6 nuts drive weight.

I raised the frame spring clamp by about 1mm and it increased the amplitude
from 125 deg. to 145 deg., so weight on the balance pivots is a major consideration.

The period varies a lot *more* with the gear meshing now than it did before (150ms vs about
40ms).

So perhaps the reduced amplitude caused by increased friction has actually *reduced* the
dominion of the balance.

And here it is with just 1 bolt on the balance wheel:

This is not necessarily sound because the balance is obviously badly out of balance,
but it does show that reducing the weight on the pivots helps, bceause now the
period variation due to meshing is mostly within about 60ms.

### Roller lantern pinion

What's the easiest way to test out a roller lantern pinion? It should mesh with the existing
driving gear.

I wanted to use sections of PTFE tube as rollers, but the gaps between the teeth is just
slightly too small.

I could 3d print the rollers? Or I could print a new driving gear with larger gaps between
the teeth?

I have some 2mm blued pivot steel rods which are a good fit in the PTFE tubes. And I'll
design a modified driving gear that has more space between the teeth. The PTFE tube has
about 4mm outer diameter.

So now I need 7 pieces of PTFE tube a bit shorter than 15mm long,
and 7 pieces of 2mm pivot steel about 29mm long.

Here we go!

And now running with 6 drive nuts again, no balance weights, and
spring re-adjusted so that the balance pivots
have approx. no load.

It occurs to me that adjustable depthing might be very helpful. Maybe if you can get the
depthing quite precisely correct then maybe that would smooth out the power transmission?

So we have amplitude from 205 to 230 deg., and period from 2.045 to 2.085 seconds.

Whereas previously we had amplitude from 195 to 215 deg., and period from 2.010 to 2.065 seconds.

So this is not obviously a massive improvement, but it's definitely not worse.

It doesn't look like the rollers are actually rolling, I'm going to try adding some oil to the
pins.

Doesn't seem to have made any difference. Does adding oil ever do anything?

I have adjusted the depthing by loosening the mounting bolts and wedging a pair of tweezers
between the shaft bearing block and the frame, and it has reduced the variation
in the period! So depthing matters.

Looks like another error where a half-period was about 0, but apart from that
you can see the period variation is much reduced, and also minimum amplitude is increased,
from 205 to 220 deg.
