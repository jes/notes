## Clock

So the plan today is to make some a finger/fork that clamps onto the wire, and make an anchor with a matching part,
and then see if we can run the deadbeat escapement with the anniversary clock balance wheel.

First, CAD.

Maybe?

It looks like the kind of complicated thing you design when you don't know what you're doing.

It allows me to move the fork up/down to vary the lever ratio, and to move the wire forwards/backwards to vary
the clearance in the fork, so hopefully it has all the adjustment I need. And obviously I can clamp it
higher/lower on the wire to change the ratio between how much the balance wheel turns and how much the fork wants to turn.
(If you imagine the wire wants to be twisted uniformly along its entire length, if the fork is 1/10 of the way
from the top to the bottom, then unconstrained it would do 1/10 as many rotations as the wheel does).

And then the next question is how I'm going to suspend the wire above the mechanism. Maybe I have to make a sort of wooden frame?
Surely there's something easier.

Maybe I screw a piece of 3x2 to the rafters, above the vice, and then clamp the wire to the wood, and position the vice so
that it interacts nicely with the mechanism.
