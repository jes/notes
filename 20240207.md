## Lathe tool

The plan is to cut off a piece of 6mm square O1 steel, grind it to a suitable shape, then harden it.

Well the angle on the end is not really ideal, but it seems to do OK in aluminium. If I were to make
it again I would not put an angle on the side, I'd just do the front and top. And maybe not
even the top, maybe just the front would do.

## Escape wheel shaft

Now let's try to use the new tool to make the escape wheel shaft.

The tool hasn't worked on blued steel, got blunted straight away. Is it too soft? Bad geometry? Or
is my blued steel too hard?

I'm going to sharpen it and then try to use it as a hand graver.

I can't get it to work, it's too soft. This is odd because Daniels definitely recommends using hardened
tool steel tools. Am I not good enough at hardening it? Am I tempering it too far? I definitely tried to
limit the temper on my last attempt, there was barely any straw colour, so it should be almost fully
hard, and yet it's not hard enough to cut the blued steel shaft.

Maybe the problem is that the piece I'm making the tool from is too large so I can't get it hot enough
to properly harden.

Making these shafts is an effort far out of proportion with the complexity of the part. Maybe I need to
rethink how I'm doing it. Probably I want CNC control, which would speed things up a lot. Maybe I need
to buy a sharp carbide tool, if I can't make one, and use one of the CNC machines as a "vertical lathe", with the cutting tool
held in the vice and the work in the spindle. Probably the router because the milling machine
is not precise enough.

## CNC router as lathe

Let's try to use the CNC router as a lathe, and if it seems easy enough then try to buy a 0-radius carbide
tool.

The machine is not rigid enough. It doesn't cut, it just moves out of the way, and then it cracked the insert.

So this is not looking like it is going to work.

If I can't use the router as a lathe, what about the milling machine?

I know the milling machine motion platform is not precise enough, it has way too much backlash.

So one option is to sort out the ballscrews on the milling machine to take the backlash out of them. Is it
just a case of buying better quality ballscrews? How do I make sure it will all fit? Is there a way to fix
it *without* replacing the ballscrews? If even replacing the ballscrews won't fix it, what will? Need to do
some reading on this.

Failing that, another option is to try to build the "micro milling machine" I keep thinking about. That would
be more expensive than just buying new ballscrews for the milling machine, but would give me more control
and would potentially be less faff. Maybe I should work out how much it would cost. Not forgetting that the
primary cost would be time.

And failing both of those, the other option is to make do with the manual lathe. Maybe that is the best place
to start. Either work out what I'm doing wrong with making tools out of O1 steel, or just buy carbide tools.
Or both.

So questions are:

1. can I get lathe tools with almost 0 nose radius?
2. how do you make a dovetail way CNC machine more precise?
3. how much would it cost to build a small, rigid, precise CNC milling machine?

### Lathe tools

My ideas here are to look at grooving tools that allow sideways cutting, normal turning tools with minimal
nose radius, and the "diamond tool holder" type thing, like this:

It looks like the only place you can buy this type of holder is https://www.eccentricengineering.com.au/ but
the website is too broken for me to even work out how much it costs. I could potentially make one myself,
but that seems like more faff than grinding custom tools for a normal holder would be.

DCGT070201 inserts exist. They have a 0.1mm nose radius, which is still bigger than I want, but potentially
tolerable, but they seem to be both expensive and not available in the UK, would have to wait for shipping
from China or America.

I couldn't tell which grooving tools allow sideways cutting, and they mostly appear to be the "moulded"
rather than "ground" type of carbide, which means they're not sharp enough for the tiny cuts I want to make.

Probably the solution to lathe tooling is to grind my own tools.

### Dovetail ways precision

Do I need to replace the ballscrews?

Can I somehow reconfigure the ballscrews without having to replace?

Are ballscrews not even the problem and I need to look elsewhere?

I think backlash can come from:

 * too much play between ballscrew and nut
 * too much play in axial bearing
 * too much slack in belt
 * loose gibs
 * loose mounting of any of the parts

Let's check all of these one by one. And in fact it may be worth taking the laundry basket off so that I can access the machine better.
