# 4th axis

Positive angles turn the axis **anti-clockwise** as you view towards the chuck. (Is that how it should be?).

[2023-09-08](20230908.md): I cut gear teeth using the 4th axis, it was 0.25mm out of concentric. I wrote a Perl script
to correct for the concentricity error, it works pretty well.

[2023-09-03](20230903.md): I re-cut the register for the chuck to try to improve concentricity.
