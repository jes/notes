## Machine building

Still todo is:

 * get shorter screws for bolting to linear rail carriages (48x)
 * assemble Z axis
 * assemble the frame
 * motor mounts
 * hook up to LinuxCNC for first tests?
 * square up all the axes, put epoxy putty (?) filler on the gantry mounts
 * mark & drill for the gantry back supports, put inserts in them, clean them up, bolt them on
 * install in laundry basket
 * fit spindle motor
 * get a VFD
 * replace LinuxCNC with grblHal

I thought I had already ordered shorter screws but I still don't seem to have them, need
to chase up. It says they were meant to have arrived on Friday, I've messaged GWR Fasteners
on eBay.

So let's start with assembling the Z axis.

Oops!

I accidentally drove the ballnut past the end of its screw, 3 of the balls fell out and the
seal came off. I will have to reassemble this ballnut.

Well 3 balls came out but I'm having trouble getting any more than 2 back in. There doesn't
seem to be room on the outer track for the 3rd ball. It must have come from this track
because I can't imagine either of the other tracks got exposed. But maybe? The question is
do I assemble it 1 ball short, or do I unscrew it further and see if I can get a ball in
the middle track, but risk making it even more than 1 ball short?

I think risk it. I already know I've successfully rebuilt this ballnut once already.

Meh, too fiddly, I can't do it. I'd have to fully disassemble it and I can't be bothered.
So I'm just going to assemble it 1 ball short.

That'll do.

Must remember: there is basically 0 tolerance for over-travel on the Z axis.

Next up: assembling the frame?

Looking good!

The uprights splay apart slightly, I think this is due to the inserts on the baseplate
sticking out, so if you tighten the lower bolts more it makes the top move out, and
if you tighten the upper bolts more it makes the top move in. Not sure whether I'll just
live with this or whether I'll file it all flat. It might be helpful if I can use
this property to square up the machine and have the gap filled with epoxy putty?

So next up is bolting the gantry to the uprights, which will require hole locations
transferred to the uprights and then holes drilling and inserts gluing in.

Then once that is set and all bolted up nicely, I can fit the gantry back pieces. Although
I'm not necessarily in a hurry to do that just yet, I can do it just as easily at any time
before installing it in the laundry basket. Which, incidentally, I'm not sure how I'm going
to do. It is very heavy.

Apart from the above list, things that still need doing are:

 * bolt gantry to uprights
 * drill holes for bolting to metal stand
