## Clock

So the next thing here is a larger diameter for the winding shaft, and some flats milled on
to it for keying, and a new winding drum to suit.

I have some thin-wall 12mm bearings, maybe I can find a 12mm shaft.

Not in a useful length. Have ordered some.

In the mean time I can make the bearing holders and winding drum inner piece.

That would suit a 12mm shaft with 2mm taken off it for the flat.

Will also need a new 120-tooth gear.

Ready for 12mm shaft.

## Dots in space

I'll try and look at the gimbal lock problem. I think the problem is that the left/right
rotation is being done around the global "up" axis, instead of the player's local one.

OK, the main issue was that the renderer took a "roll" parameter instead of an "up"
vector. Fixed now.

Next up, let's add bullets.

OK, got some initial bullets. They just shoot straight out and carry on at a constant
velocity until they exit the world.

Occlusion spheres?

There's an occlusion sphere in the middle, with yellow lights all over it, blocking out
the stars behind.

Todo is:

 * gravity?
 * particle effects
 * "physics unification", i.e. don't duplicate all the physics code across every object that moves or collides
 * some sort of basic game

## Countdown

Someone sent me a bug report about the Countdown game, the pause/resume button doesn't
actually work properly! It only pauses the animation, but the clock still runs down in
the background so it jumps ahead when you resume.

Fixed now with Cursor's help, I'm surprised nobody mentioned it before though, it's been
this way for years.

## Prompts as source code

Following on from https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/prompts-as-source-code.html I
want to have a first pass at making some minor web app where I work only in prompts.

I'm thinking I finally make a polynomial interpolator. So the spec will say something
about making a web page that does polynomial interpolation for you, and then there will
be a (shell? Perl? Python?) script that will do some LLM stuff to get it built.

It might be good if it automatically ran a linter over the created project. Not sure.

For this one we can probably just have it write a single HTML file that contains CSS and
JavaScript inline.

I can't work out how to use my email address for Anthropic. I think Mike invited it to his
organisation and now I don't have the option to leave. I tried signing up with "+2" in
the email address but Anthropic silently drops it.

I'll go via OpenRouter instead.

Well I have done it but it is not working very well.

It keeps making pages that don't look nice but don't actually work properly.

I'll try getting o1 to iterate on the spec to see if it can tighten it up.

Meh, still didn't work.

Let's try Opus instead of Sonnet.

Nope, still didn't work. Actually worse if anything.
