## Balance frequency

Yesterday I said that as the drive torque increases, the tick rate drops. And I also said
that as the balance wheel gains amplitude, the tick rate drops. And yet I did not make the
connection between these two effects.

Maybe the only reason the tick rate drops as the drive torque increases is because the
amplitude increases!

So let's trying replacing the copper hairspring with a steel one and see if either or both
of those effects is improved.

## Ceiling

Alleyway is mostly done: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4682

Just a bit more to do along under the gutter.

Plastebroard is all done: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4683

And I did the bit under the gutter: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4684

Now just need a man to plaster the plasterboard and Emma to paint everything.
