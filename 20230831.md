## Watches

I'm reading "A practical course in horology" by Harold C. Kelly with the aim
of making my own watch movement.

* On page 25, on the topic of determining the thickness of a mainspring,
step 3 is "measure the inside of the barrel and divide by 12.5" - but
where does 12.5 come from?

* When I make a watch gear I turn a blank on the lathe and then transfer it to
the 4th axis on the milling machine to cut the teeth. Moving it between machines
introduces a concentricity error of about 0.3mm. Is this caused by the chuck register on the 4th
axis being off-centre, or is it just unavoidable? I should try re-cutting the
chuck register, and failing that develop a workflow for using the dial indicator
to measure the high spot, and a perl script for correcting the error.

* I need to develop a workflow for crossing out tiny gears. Either a high-speed spindle
for the milling machine, or just do it on the router. Probably the router is fine as it
is such a tiny amount of material to remove.

* I need a way to drill tiny holes in gears on the lathe. Probably a pin vise that I can
put in the drill chuck, but I bought a set of pin vises before and they are very poor
quality. Either get better ones, or decide on a drill size and make a collet (but how
will you drill the hole in the collet?!)

* I need to work out how to make escapements. Possibly continue experimenting in FreeCAD
until I have the broad principles figured out, and then adapt the oscillating engine
simulator into a pin pallet escapement simulator.

## Meshmill

* Meshmill still needs to cut helical paths in rotary mode, and I need to sort out
the UI (i.e. hide irrelevant fields) in rotary mode. And I need to make the "origin"
offsetting stuff work in rotary mode.

* It would be cool to be able to load in an STL of the "stock", and have it generate a
starting heightmap from that to feed in as the read-stock of the first job. Slightly
more annoying than it sounds as you need to specify the dimensions independently. Maybe
I should move away from PNG heightmaps and use a custom format.

## Bangle.js commute timer

The ETA calculation seems good, but the delta time was miles off. What is up there?

## Motorbike

Need to make a silencer bracket, and maybe fit the new handlebar grips.

## Roof

When the foam fillers arrive (why haven't they arrived yet? I paid for Parcelforce 48, 6 days ago!),
need to fit the flashing against the house, then barge boards around the low edge, then move on
to the interior.

## Selling

Need to sell the Rekluse auto-clutch.
