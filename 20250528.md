## Isoform

With o3's masked clones thing we make blends like this:

I'm wondering what happens if we do the thing about weighting the blend
radius by the dot product of the surface normals.

Meh, no good.

That comes from multiplying the blend radius by `1 - abs(dot(n1,n2))`.

It does remove some of the excess blend material, but it leaves a discontinuous
field and it doesn't remove all of it.
