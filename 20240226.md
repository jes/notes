## G-code sender

I think I've changed my mind about switching to Gtk4. I'm going to persist with Gio. It is less work
to make Gio act how I want than to switch to Gtk4, and it's not even obvious that Gtk4 will be easier
even after I switch, it's a much bigger beast to tame.

The main concrete gripe that I had was that I had no sensible way to make a toolbar that would wrap to
the next row when it overflows, but that ended up being less than 70 lines: https://github.com/jes/pugsender/blob/140242a581bfd3077cd4d037612d389498726e2a/toolbar.go

So I'm sticking with Gio for now, and I spent most of the morning tidying up various TODO items.

## Milling machine

So now the plan is to take the motors, ballscrews, ballnuts off the milling machine, and get the
machine out of the tub.

I've got the head off and liberated the ballscrew + ballnut. A loose bolt fell out of the inside of the head, lol,
don't know where it came from.

I found the bolts holding the ballnut for the X axis were loose. Haven't yet managed to get the X axis
off the machine though, and ran out of time.
