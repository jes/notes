## Gear cutting

I think today's plan is to make cutters for cycloidal-ish wheels and pinions at module 0.2, and then try to make some
gears, and make a frame to let them mesh together. I should make the frame oversized so that I can add
provision for a mainspring and escapement at a later date.

So what geometry do I need for a cutter for module 0.2 gears?

Stan Bray's "Making Clocks" says that for modules "0.45 to 1.1 to 1.5" the addendum radius should
be 1.93 times the module. He doesn't say how it varies outside this range.

But if that were true, the radius would be 1.93 * 0.2 = 0.386. Which would need a cutter small than
0.8mm to make.

But I don't trust his numbers at all, because for example he says "full tooth depth" is 2.95 times
module for modules 0.45, and 1.1 to 1.5, but is 3.38 times module for modules 0.5 to 1.0. Why the
discontinuity? I think he has badly misunderstood something.

I'll read this [Designing Cycloidal Gears](https://www.csparks.com/watchmaking/CycloidalGears/index.jxl) page.

Oh, skip reading that, he has a [Cycloidal Gear Calculator](https://www.csparks.com/watchmaking/CycloidalGears/CycloidCalculator.html)

Sadly this says the addendum radius is 0.44mm, I certainly don't think I have a 0.8mm cutter that I can cut
steel with. Let's just try and work something out.

## Escapement design

I've read a bit more of Gould, and come across Berthoud's detent escapement:

This looks even simpler than Le Roy's! The impulse pin is beveled on its "back" side
so that on the return swing it lifts the detent arm away from the balance wheel axially.
So the detent arm is its own spring.
