## Webmail

What is wrong with the AI Test User emails?

1. shows CSS in the body area
2. has its own "panels" that seem to overlap the borders of the body area

OK, it's because for some reason this is the `body_text` rather than `body_html`.

So `simple_format` is *not* preventing XSS.

If I print `<%= @email.body_text %>` it works correctly,
but `<%= simple_format @email.body_text %>` or `sanitize` or `auto_link` all pass
through HTML tags that they shouldn't. Baffling, especially that `sanitize` is not
sanitising.

OK, `sanitize` is meant to strip *dangerous* HTML, not *all* HTML. So it is doing
the right thing. You want `h` to escape all html.

So that solves the main problem, of being able to sneak through unescaped html by calling it
`text/plain`. But why are the AI Test User emails not looking like html?

It's because it's not a multitype email! It's a single-part email where the Content-Type is
`text/html`.

So I need to check the Content-Type of the email and display it accordingly. Good, done.

Next up: pipelining. I saw in the documentation at https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.0/gems/net-imap/Net/IMAP.html
that you can invoke multiple commands simultaneously on a single connection, by using `Thread.start`.

Let's try that?

Doesn't work. Although you can do multiple commands simultaneously, the selected mailbox is a property
of the session rather than the command. I may have to hack it to somehow do proper pipelining.

OK, let's make `EmailContacts` now. So this is a table that maps an email to all of the contents that are
in it. So an `EmailContact` has:

 * email
 * contact
 * displayname
 * field

So if it is to me, it would have me with `field="to"`, etc.

OK, so Rails has a cool thing for this, you make your `EmailContact` model,
and then in `Email` you say:

    has_many :contacts, through: :email_contacts

And then for some Email object `e`, you have `e.contacts` which is all of the associated `Contact`
objects, and also `e.email_contacts` which is the associated `EmailContact` objects, which has
the metadata from the extra fields. Super cool.

Update: you need to also explicitly add:

    has_many :email_contacts

And then when I parse an email how do I populate these tables? Done.

Trying to open a Stripe link I'm getting an error from Firefox about "cross-origin opener policies"??
Never heard of that before. It means I'm missing `rel="noopener"` on the link. But I *do* have
`rel="noopener"` on the link!

You need `sandbox="allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"` on the `iframe`, fixed now.

Now I guess I want to delete the `to` and `from` fields on the Email model, and grab them from
`EmailContacts` instead.

OK, seems to be working. One issue is that it now only shows one contact per email in the email view.

If I use `where` instead of `find_by` then I get all of them instead of just one.

It is now taking 700ms to render the index page, presumably because it has to do so many extra
queries to grab out the contacts from different tables. How do I make it get them all in one go with
a JOIN?

You can do `@emails = current_user.emails.includes(:email_contacts)`, but it doesn't seem to be
any faster. Am I missing an index?

It's because `email.to` uses `email_contacts.where` which always hits the database. I should use
`email_contacts.select` instead.

Now it is faster, but still has to look up the email address for every email contact, so
probably I want to add `:contacts` to the `includes()` list?

Yes, another improvement.

And finally it is also looking up attachments for every email, so let's include that as well.
Need to include `:attachments_attachments` for that.

Now it's 100ms to render the index page. I think I want an index on the date field of `emails`.

An index on `(user_id,date)` is what I want, works well now, about 75ms, of which 55ms is in
"Views" and 10ms in "ActiveRecord". What are my Views doing slow? Or is that just normal?
Just normal according to ChatGPT.

I guess now I want to render the contacts on the email page using some sort of "component" that
I can reuse across all the contacts in all the fields. It should emphasise their display name
but leave the email address visible. Apparently "Rails Components" are a thing, or you can also
render "partials".

Components gives you a way to add controller-like code to the component. I think a partial is enough
for now.

Seems to work OK, I have managed to make it look awfully ugly though.

Auto-link doesn't put `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"`.

## The Screener

OK, let's look at the feature I'm doing all of this for: The Screener. Copied from hey.com.

When a new email comes in, if it's not from a contact we have "screened in", then the email
goes into The Screener instead of the inbox.
The main view will still only be the inbox. If there are unseen emails in the Screener then we'll
have a label at the top saying so. If we click it then we go into The Screener, which shows us unseen emails
from the last 7 days from non-screened-in contacts. At the bottom we can maybe "Load more" if we want
to go back further, but by default they're not shown.

For each email in The Screener we can: view it, dismiss it (mark seen), or screen the person in.

We maybe kind of want the mailbox view to be a "component" that takes a filter and sort order and shows us
emails according to those.

One issue is what if an email has multiple "From" values? Consult ChatGPT on that.

What is the simplest way to start?

 * make the main inbox view only show emails from contacts who are screened in
 * make the alternative view that only shows *unseen* emails from contacts who are screened out, and allows screening in
 * make the main view point you to the alternative view if there is anything to show
 * make the email view page have the ability to screen in/out

Good, is working.

## Mark as seen

Emails should be marked as seen as soon as they are viewed, unfortunately we can't do that in the GET
controller because Hotwire prefetches the page. ChatGPT suggests using a "Stimulus Controller" to POST
an update to mark it as seen.

I have done what it suggested, passing in the URL to fetch with `data-mark-seen-url-value` and grabbing
it out with `this.data.get("url")`, but it is coming out as null, hmm.

OK, it is just totally different, working now, I consulted https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/reference/values

By having `mark_seen` and `mark_unseen` return "204 No Content", they don't replace the page view with
anything. However we do need the "Mark as unseen" button text to change to "Mark as seen" once it succeeds.

## Todo

 * different screening for companies vs people
 * 3 levels of screening: in, out, and undecided
 * somehow we are fetching fonts from `m.media-amazon.com` on html emails
 * when we send an email to someone, automatically screen them in
 * screen in an entire domain
 * check SPF/DKIM/DMARC
 * Forward, Reply, Reply All
 * share link
 * show dates on the inbox view
 * automatically fetch messages in background periodically
 * IDLE mode? even if just an external daemon that tells it to do a fetch now
 * show full headers
 * push emails in realtime
 * Progressive Web App?
 * Starred
 * Bubble Up
 * Delete
 * infinite scroll index page
 * tags
 * filter/search
 * configure user accounts
 * support multiple email accounts on one user account
 * prevent signup
