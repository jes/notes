## Clock

It ran for about 3 hours based on the clockwatcher data. Again stopped with the
remontoire completely unwound, and again wound up again after I tapped the frame.

So I think there are a couple of avenues here:

1. obviously increase the drive weight
2. reduce losses in the train (how?)
3. reduce power required to run the escapement, and therefore reduce remontoire weight

I think there are losses in the train due to misaligned bearings. If the bearings
on a shaft don't point directly towards each other then there is some pressure against
the races which will increase friction. So maybe the easiest thing to do is to make
sure the bearings are aligned properly, or alternatively come up with a way to make
them self-aligning.

## Flywheel truck

I've made the wheels a bit smaller and further apart, to make the proportions a bit
better.

Now with cut-outs for the gears to run in, and supports for the bearings:

Last step is to make it look more like a truck. Harder than it sounds.
