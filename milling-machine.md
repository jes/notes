# CNC milling machine

Backlash measured on [2023-10-13](20231013.md) as follows:

* X axis: **0.11mm**
* Y axis: **0.11mm**
* Z axis: **0.13mm**

The cause of the backlash is not yet known, I suspect the ballscrews/ballnuts.

I subsequently applied 0.10mm backlash compensation to each axis, but this may come back to bite me.
