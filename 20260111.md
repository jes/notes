Finally have rear mudguards. It's relatively ugly with the bit of aluminium angle sticking down, but I can live with that.
In fact I could chamfer off the end so that it's not so obvious, I should do that.

And now I need to disassemble it, paint everything, and put it back together and it's finished. Just in time to start building
the car.

And "knot block" primer on the chassis and foot plates: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6411

Next up is sanding the rear mudguard parts and apply the "knot block" primer. Then take the front wheels off and track
rods off, mask off the tyres and stub axles, and spray grey primer on everything that is getting spraypainted, plus on the
track rods.

Then green paint on:

 * chassis
 * foot plates
 * bonnet
 * mudguard parts
 * front axle

Yellow paint on:

 * wheels
 * stripe(s?) on bonnet

Black brush paint (need to acquire) on:

 * track rods
 * brake pedal shaft
 * gear lever shaft
 * steering shaft
