## Thin barrel, direct-drive hands

I kind of subconsciously discarded this idea the other day, but it might be easier to make the "thin barrel"
with much stiffer wire, and make it turn only once every 12 hours, and have the hand driven directly off
the barrel arbor, instead of having the 24x reduction thing on top.

That one works out to about 17600 bph, so obviously a workable
arrangement. It does have some 6-leaf pinions but if they became
8-leaf it would still be about 10000 bph.

Total gears: **8**

Pros:

 * minimises the number of gears required
 * driving the hand is trivial

Cons:

 * only works if stiff thin mainspring is possible

I think this is strictly an improvement over the "hollow barrel".
It has all the same pros and much fewer cons.

But I would move the thin barrel so that it sits between the movement and the dial, with
both of the movement plates beneath it. The barrel arbor will run all the way down to the
lower plate so I think it will be well supported, and that's the only piece that turns.
It's OK if turning the barrel itself has a lot of friction because that will only be done
by hand when winding.
