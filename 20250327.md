## Grab handles

Types of grab handle:

 * setting a dimension directly (box size, sphere radius)
 * setting a dimension relative to something else on the part (corner radius)
 * setting an axis direction (move in 3 axes but constrain to length=1)
 * setting a rotation angle (move in 2 axes and constrain to length=1)
 * setting the object centre point (show a fixed-length line and move the origin point instead of the length)
 * setting an abstract value ("scale" of a lattice, copies of a pattern, amplitude/frequency of a deformation; you might want some handle to drag for this but it doesn't really directly correspond to a feature on the surface)

Currently we only support the first type.
