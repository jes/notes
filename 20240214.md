## Go channels

I've worked out how the Grbl module should use channels!

I should *not* have a dedicated "writer" goroutine, or either of the
dedicated "tickers". Instead I should just have one goroutine, and it
uses `select` to read from the tickers, and to read from the channel
that is telling it what commands to send, and to read from the output
of the serial device (may need a second goroutine to turn serial reads
into channel reads though). And it also uses `select` when it has a status
update, in a loop, so that arbitrarily many readers can consume grbl
status updates. The status update would be its own `GrblStatus` object or
something, so that it doesn't change once it's come out of the channel.

This would solve most of the race conditions, but there's still the one where
Grbl itself sends an update describing the size of the serial buffer, and then
we send a command to it, and then we receive the update about the serial buffer
and it looks like we've calculated it wrong. Not sure anything can be
done about that though.
