## Escapement simulator

I've added some springs to pull the anchor towards the centre position, and configurable mass on the anchor - it's effectively
now a balance wheel, although not rendered as such.

Next steps are:

* render an actual balance wheel
* allow separation of the balance wheel from the anchor, so I can compare the amplitudes
* calibrate units for the "arbitrary units" fields
* make pivot friction adjustable (?)
* make a 3d printed model of an escapement with the anchor directly on the wheel, and another of the same except the anchor is separate from the wheel, and compare the performance

## Unanswered questions

* How much torque can I actually get out of the mainspring?

* How much torque do I require at the escapement?

* Will it be too powerful for me to be able to wind it up?

* How much variation in torque is there between fully wound and empty?

* How far away from isochronous is the "pallet pins directly on balance wheel" escapement?

## Plan

I tried to add a balance wheel to the escapement simulator but it makes it behave weirdly. It seems
like constraining the pallet pin to a wheel that can rotate around its centre acts very differently to
constraining the pallet pin to have a fixed distance from that wheel's centre. Even though they mean the
same thing. Maybe I kind of give up on Matter.js after all.

This evening I want to design a 3d-printable model of the "pallet pins directly on balance wheel" escapement
(I should come up with a better name for it). And tomorrow hopefully I can try it out in between roofing.
It should have support for adjustable weights on the balance wheel and adjustable springs. It probably wants to
stand vertically (screw it to a piece of wood), so that I can drive it with a weight on a string. And I want
to try to use pivots made of steel wire, running in tapered holes.
