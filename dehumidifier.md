# Dehumidifier

I have a desiccant-based dehumidifier in the garage to prevent mould.

It is a Meaco DD8L. [Instruction manual here](meaco-dd8l.pdf).

I propose that I want it on low fan mode so that it is not in "Continuous running mode",
and on 1-droplet of water (minimum).

For some reason the 1-droplet mode allows the highest humidity and 3-droplet mode brings it to lowest humidity which seems backwards.
