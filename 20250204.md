## Clock

I'm going to go up to a 120-tooth gear on the winding shaft, for another 20% increase in
runtime.

And also could do a 180mm diameter escape wheel with more teeth on it. Meh,
can't really fit any more, I'll just leave it.

So then the next thing is adding another shaft and gear reduction stage. Currently we
are running with 5 nuts, so imagine 6 after changing from 100 teeth to 120 teeth.

Another 12:1 reduction would need 72 nuts, or 6kg. Is that too much for a 5mm shaft?

I think try with a 5mm shaft and if it flexes too much then do something else.

I also need a 6kg weight probably.

I've ordered 10kg of lead shot, will try to come up with some sort of container that
I can load it into.

So that now has 2 stages of 120:10 reduction between the winding drum and the remontoire,
so 144:1 overall.

It isn't keeping the remontoire fully wound but it *is* winding it up a bit
before it completely stops, so I think this is just slightly short of the required
drive weight.

Starting from 13:21, I've set clockwatcher going, and we have 4 wraps of string
on the winding drum. I can't wind it all the way up because the "weight" would catch
on the table.

I think it should run for about 44 hours before it uses up 4 wraps of string, if
it doesn't stop before then.

I messed about with the balance pivots about 16:50, this had a drastic effect on
the period, jumping from about 7.45 seconds to 7.50 seconds. I fiddled again
and it came back to roughly what it was before.

It stopped not long after, but with the remontoire almost fully wound, unsure why.
