## Lathe microscope bracket

I said:

> the carriage microscope is slightly too close to the work, the position where it's in focus is just beyond the end of its travel. Also it doesn't have enough travel left/right or forward/back, so I should make a new mount for it that rectifies these problems. Also the mount is a bit floppy, and it would be better if the eyepieces ended up at 45 degrees instead of vertical.

So it needs:

* spacing upwards
* longer slots in all directions
* more rigid if possible (PC Blend?)
* 45 degree tilt

The 45-degree tilt is the hardest part, because I don't know where the actual focal axis is.

What I can do is drive it to the end of its travel, position something at the focal point,
and then measure this position relative to some reference on the bracket, then I can put
a datum line there in CAD, and then I know I need to rotate the mounting surface
around that line.

It's about **45.5 mm** above the surface of the bracket that clamps down to the carriage,
and about **7.5 mm** back from the front of it.

Oh, that's when it's at the end of travel. I should measure the length of travel and
position a *second* datum line at the bottom. The travel is about 40mm.

So actually I think it will work if the flat bit that the microscope bolts to
is level with the rotation axis. So that should be easy enough.

Sighting across that surface, I can see the datum line: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4753

Now want to tilt the surface, but maintain that property.

Well, it's not exactly pretty...

But maybe it'll do the job?

Actually, I'll just add a bit more rigidity...

Lovely job. Let's print it in PC Blend and see how we go. Actually just PLA for now. If I like it but want it stronger,
then PC Blend. Maybe rather than PC Blend I should instead find a way to integrate some metal rods to make it stiffer.
I think stiffness will be more important than strength.

## Metal escapement

Let's go with 1x scale, but module 0.4 on the gears, and 0.5mm for the small pivots.

And a layout of the whole mechanism: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4761

This is mostly the same as the model on the desk, except with a 7-tooth pinion instead
of 8-tooth, and corresponding reduction on the barrel gear from 40 teeth to 35 teeth.

The barrel gear has a 2mm bore, for a 2mm rod to go through, with the idea that the 2mm rod can be removed
to wind the string.

I didn't make the pallet fork in the "English lever" shape, but I will want to move to that eventually because it
allows the escape wheel and balance wheel to get closer together.

I will probably also want to experiment with making the lever longer, because that allows for a larger balance wheel.
