## Custom milling cutters

I'm going to try to make a custom 1mm end mill, just to see if it works, or how well it works.

The smallest collet for the router is 3mm, so I'll use 3mm silver steel, taper it down to a 1mm
straight section, and then machine half the straight section away.

Do I also need to provide some clearance to stop the back of the tool from rubbing? I think skip
that for now, but I did consider that I could turn the cutting section slightly eccentric to the
shank, and then machine it in half so that the cutting tip is at the largest radius, which
gets you some back clearance for free.

I have this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5251

It is about 1.2mm diameter. Needs some tidying up, then hardening.

Having the collet chuck on the CNC router is *very* handy, but it is not clamped down hard enough so
it shifts every time I tighten/loosen it. Might be worth making some sort of fixture plate for accurate
positioning. Bonus points if the chuck can be removed without moving the location of the register, so
that it can be put back in almost exactly the same place.

Machining the flat on the cutter has left slightly rounded edges. Maybe I should have taken some spring passes?

Let's try and cut some brass with it!

Great success?

It raised a bit of a burr, and it made some unhappy noises, but it seems to have worked. All at 0.1mm depth of cut,
with several passes. The "vertical" cut
was 24000 rpm and 100 mm/min, the "horizontal" one was 9000 rpm and 60 mm/min. Doesn't seem to have made a lot of difference.
The cutter does not seem substantially worn.

I think I should do most of my machining with "proper" cutters, but I can almost certainly make small custom cutters to
get into tight corners.

I'm going to try to sharpen it and try again, see if I can stop it from raising a burr.

I sharpened it by rubbing it against the "fine whetstone", which is so soft that it gets rubbed away.

Doesn't seem to have made a lot of difference, possibly it's a bit worse, but possibly that is because I was a bit more
aggressive with the cut.

So what can we conclude?

It is very easy to make your own tiny D-bit cutters, and they do work, but not spectacularly well?

## Thin barrel

Could I machine down the new thin barrel (& hub) to accept the 0.35mm piano wire? Would
that work better?
