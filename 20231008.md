## Movement layout

I was experimenting with laying out a movement for about 8000-10000 bph using module 0.4 gears.

One problem I keep running into is that if a gear later in the train is larger than an
earlier one, then they interfere:

The shaft for the smaller gears passes through the same space as the larger gear.

The obvious solutions are:

1. make sure the gears always decrease in size as you go along the train
2. use separate bridges/cocks so that the shafts can "overlap" the gears

Making the gears always decrease in size is not good for this layout because the first
gear's size is limited by the thickness of the barrel. We want to make the barrel thin, so
that there is more space inside, but we want the first gear to be big, so that we don't
need so many.

Using separate bridges is a lot of effort and will add thickness, so I also want to
avoid that.

So... what do? Is there a third solution? What if there is an idler in contact with the barrel,
and the idler turns on a screw instead of an ordinary pivot? It is screwed into (a standoff on?)
the top plate, and the "real" first gear of the train can pass over (under...) the head of the
screw? And then the first gear gets to cover the thickness of the barrel *plus* the diameter
of the idler.

I think it is OK for the idler to run on a screw instead of an ordinary pivot because it is at
the start of the train where there is the most torque available.

The configuration above (with interfering gears) would need 1100 bph, so I need a factor of 8
on that.

Let's have a look at adding an idler that runs on a screw...

Well it certainly helps with geartrain layout.

But I'm not sure there's going to be enough room for the escapement: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4797

Even with the tiny balance wheel from the metal escapement model, it looks like it
wouldn't really fit. Even if you make it fit, there's barely any room left
to connect the upper and lower frame plates.
