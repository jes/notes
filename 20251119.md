This is definitely getting somewhere. I think one more round of filling and sanding and it'll be done. And in fact
I may be better off "filling" with several coats of primer anyway because it really doesn't need a lot and it is
quite hard to apply the bodyfiller neatly.

I'm not going to put a roundover on the sides. It is fine as is and don't want to ruin it.

## Clock

I set the clock going yesterday afternoon and it is still going these evening, nearly 30 hours later. So maybe
this is just working now?

Next steps would be to add something to attach a winding key to, instead of having to rotate the drum by hand,
and add a dial and some hands. Maybe it's nearly finished.
