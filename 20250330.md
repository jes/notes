## Flywheel truck

Comparing this to some other flywheel car toys she has, I actually
think it would be better off with a higher gear ratio and less weight
on the flywheel.

So the plan is to put the old gears back on, but remove most of the
bolts from the flywheel.

Update: no, it's worse.

I think there is too much friction in the geartrain. Maybe I ought to
try again with 1 less gear in the train (so 2 stages of reduction
instead of 3), and either soak the bearings in alcohol to get the
grease out, or use 2mm pivot steel in plain bearings.
