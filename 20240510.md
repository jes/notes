## Flexwing simulator

I've started playing around with a "flexwing simulator" using Planck.js. It's not working yet but I have
learnt a few things.

The biggest thing I've learnt is how critical airspeed is. If your airspeed is too low and you're pitched up,
there's basically nowhere you can go. Even with the bar all the way back (wing all the way down) you can't
make the thing rotate forwards because the thrust is pushing the trike forwards, and if the airspeed is too low
then there's nothing to counter it, so the trike keeps rotating upwards. You'd probably need to cut power to let
the trike roll back down, then let it accelerate towards the ground to pick up airspeed so that you can
apply power again.
