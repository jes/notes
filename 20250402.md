This has been running for over 36 hours without stopping, but
I connected up the clockwatcher at some point yesterday after it
had already been running overnight and part of the day.

The amplitude drops precipitously at one point, I'm guessing the remontoire didn't rewind properly.

I think the plan is:

 * pour some resin or something into the weight tube, to add weight and prevent the balls from spilling if it breaks
 * soak all the bearings in IPA, because I know some of them haven't been
 * make better bearing blocks for the remontoire
 * make better bearing block for the "middle" wheel
 * print the balance shaft bearings in the other orientation
 * longer barrel
 * winding mechanism
 * face, hands
 * legs
 * perspex panels

## Isoform core problems

Remaining core problems:

 * try making `VoxelNode` just classify voxels as "in" or "out" and then propagate distances from there - so that we can use it for renormalisation
 * targeting fillets/chamfers
 * type custom SDFs in some Peptide DSL
 * isomorphism between tree view and a human-friendly text representation (and maybe use this representation to save your file?)
 * gears, text, helical extrusions
 * use sparse octree and interval arithmetic for marching cubes in mesh export
 * can we use bounding boxes in unions etc. to say that if the distance to the bounding box of the next child is greater than the current minimum distance to the surface, then we don't even bother evaluating the next child?
 * let Peptide functions return "structs" instead of just scalar values and vectors
 * pass Lipschitz constant separately from distance field, so that it can be used to adjust step factor without also messing up the mean distance
 * select a node in the tree by clicking on the surface (have the SDF "struct" tell you which primitive's `uniqueId` the distance came from)

## Peptide structs

You can get most of the way here by passing a plain JavaScript object
that has multiple Peptide expressions in it.

The problem is that when you turn it in to JS/GLSL code, you get a scalar
out at the end instead of a struct.

So then let's imagine `P.struct({a: ..., b: ..., c: ...})` where
all the "..." are Peptide expressions. In JS code we can simply
return an object with fields that are the evaluations of the
expressions. In GLSL we will need to declare the struct somewhere.

Probably the only struct we need to declare is the one that is
finally returned. Any intermediate structs are better off just
disappearing into the expression tree.

So another function `P.field(struct, name)` would select out the
named field from the struct.

And for the SDFs we'd want fields:

 * distance (float)
 * colour (vec3)
 * uniqueId (float)

`TreeNode.min`/`max` can automatically select `uniqueId`, and interpolate
colour. But everything else that has to deal with a child node is now
going to have to laboriously track the `colour` and `uniqueId`, and
extract the `distance` separately.

So another way is we could add "metadata" to Peptide nodes. And
when you construct a node it will automatically inherit metadata from
its first child that has any, but let you override it if you want.

Primitives will have to explicitly set their metadata. Modifiers of 1
child can probably ignore it completely. Combinators may have to combine
them sensibly, but may get it for free if `TreeNode.min`/`max` does it.

And then at code generation, sometimes we'll want the struct with
all the metadata, and sometimes we'll just want the primary value.
Maybe just always give the struct, and you have to get the primary value
if that's what you want?

Carrying metadata around statically won't work, because it won't allow
selecting between nodes at runtime.

So we basically do want the explicit `P.struct` thing.

And I think `P.field` needs to look "through" the struct, so that
a tree that looks up fields in structs can still be handled properly
by the `simplify()` code that assumes the children are all referenced
by `left`/`right`/`third`.

And then we'll say the only things that you can do with structs is
access their fields and evaluate them as a root node. And then nothing
else cares about it. And since "accessing their fields" just shortcuts
the `struct` and gives back the field directly, the only place a
`struct` node can be is the root of the tree.

So then do we special-case `struct`s in code generation so that it
knows about all of the children? Or do we say that any node can have
arbitrarily-many children, just so that code generation handles it
automatically?

Maybe we make the calling code specifically know about structs, so
that it can declare them etc. in the surrounding GLSL code? Or at
least know what type name to use?

OK, I have `P.struct`/`P.field` working in the "interpreted" case,
with a unit test checking that common subexpression elimination
works.

Now how to handle structs for compiled code?

What I want to get is SSA code that computes each field individually
and then return a struct of them all at the end.

So probably I "hide" the `struct` from the code generation, but
remember which value corresponds to which field, and then if the root
node was a struct, I construct it and return it right at the end,
otherwise just return the last value.

Great, that's working for JS code. Now need JS intervals, GLSL,
GLSL intervals.

For propagating material information (starting with just colour),
I think we'll let each `TreeNode` optionall set a "colour" vec3, and
if it is set then its `peptide()` will overwrite the colour generated
by `makePeptide()`, otherwise it will leave it blank.

And maybe primitives will always have to pick the default colour if not
set?

Actually to start with let's always just propagate the child node's
colour, and make a `ColourNode` which overwrites it, similar to
how `TransformNode` is its own node type but will eventually be
common to all.

But I'm getting ahead of myself, still need GLSL structs.

GLSL has no way for me to return a populated struct without knowing
the name of the struct. So I think the caller will need to tell
me the name of the struct if the expression is a struct.

OK, great success, I now have working tests for all combinations
of JavaScript/GLSL and normal/interval mode, with structs.

## Object colours

The first useful thing to do with structs is let objects have different
colours.

So that will mean changing the way Peptide is used in `TreeNode` so
that instead of just yielding a distance, it instead yields a struct
with:

 * distance: float
 * color: vec3

We'll accept the American spelling of "color" to make it easier for
Claude.

And then:

 * `TreeNode`'s `getSDF()` will wrap the Peptide expression in `P.field(expr, 'distance')` so that it works like it currently does
 * the shader code generation will have to pick a name for the struct, and then use the colour for rendering
 * `TreeNode.min`/`max` will have to choose/blend colours
 * every `TreeNode` has to return a Peptide struct instead of float
 * primitives will use a default colour
 * add a `ColorNode` for changing object colours

Whoa, working!

The sphere has one colour and the gyroid has the other, and it correctly
colours the surfaces based on which primitive they came from.

The "register allocation" in SSA seems like it needs to know about
structs, because I only got it to work by turning that off.

It's not blending colours yet, it just thresholds them at whichever
distance is min/max:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6097

OK, sweet, blending colours now:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6098

In the long-term I expect not to care very much about blending
colours, because I'll be using different colours for different
conceptual "objects", rather than within a single object. But still
cool to have and easy to do.

At some point I could probably do with more robust type checking on
structs, to make sure they all have all the fields. Or alternatively
make `TreeNode` have a struct constructor that automatically sets
default values for fields you're missing?

Still need to fix:

 * whatever is going wrong with register allocation
 * make all of the other `TreeNode` types return structs

The register allocation problem was that we were renaming the
variables that were the result of the computations of the struct fields,
but still using the original names when assigning to the resulting struct.

So if a field was originally called `f1234`, and `greedyAllocate()`
renamed it to `f0`, we'd still be trying to use `f1234`.

The solution to the "type safety" thing is to have `TreeNode.peptide()`
check everything, and fill in default values where applicable.

I think I've made all the other node types return structs now.

## Targeted fillets

An edge is always formed by a discontinuity. (Fact).

A discontinuity is always formed by a `min` or `max` of 2 more
fundamental objects. (Maybe? But maybe the idea is useful even if not).

Therefore we can target fillets by choosing a `blendRadius` based on the
`uniqueId` of the 2 surfaces being blended.

Define a "surface query" as the "coordinates under cursor" thing, except
it gives you the surface `uniqueId` instead of the coordinates.

So the UI could be that you click on the first surface, then click
on the second surface, then select your blend radius. Or else
you click on the edge and then it does "surface queries" in some
small-ish neighbourhood (either in screen space or object space)
and picks the 2 closest surfaces to the click point?

This does mean that *all* `min`/`max` operations that want to
support targeted fillets need to have separate `uniqueId` for each
of the child surfaces. For example a cube is the intersection of
6 half-spaces. If each half-space has a different id then we can
potentially set a different blend radius on each edge.

As a first pass, just being able to set a different blend radius on
each pair of `TreeNode`s would be good.

So then the hard part is how to look up blend radiuses by the pair of
`TreeNode`s? Given that one or both of the arguments could vary
at runtime.

Do we have to make a big "blend radius selector" expression that is like:

    blendRadius = (a.id == 0 && b.id == 1 ? 0.1
                : (a.id == 1 && b.id == 2 ? 0.5
                : (a.id == 1 && b.id == 3 ? 1.0
                : (a.id == 1 && b.id == 4 ? 0.5
                : 0.0
                ))));

And we could either use the same one everywhere (although it won't
prune very well because `a` and `b` are dynamic), or have a function
in `TreeNode` that computes only the subset of the `blendRadius`
expression that is applicable for its own subtrees.

And then a policy question, but not a "core problem", is how this
interacts with nodes that already have their own `blendRadius`?

## Click to select

1. Propagate node `uniqueId` in SDF
2. In the ray march on hover, remember the id you hit
3. On click, select the hovered id

Whoa, done, that was actually really easy!

Right-clicking on the 3d view should pop up the same context menu as
on the tree view.

Also easy! Great success, this feels like all the complexity I've
been building up is finally paying off.

One issue is that you can only right click on your base primitives,
but it feels like after you apply a modifier to it, right-clicking
should let you stack something else *on top* of the modifier, rather
than underneath it.

One idea is we could let you collapse nodes in the tree to make them
into "false leafs", and when we find that the node under the cursor is
collapsed (or inside a collapsed subtree), we walk up until we find
its first parent that is actually visible in the tree view, and select
that one instead?

And also, any time we add a new thing, we collapse it, so that its
children become unselectable?

Another thing would be "multiple select", and then applying some
combinator to the multiple selection. I think they would have to be
sibling nodes.

Or maybe we only allow click-to-select of top-level objects under
Document? So we'll return 2 ids:

 * an id for the top-level object under Document
 * an id for the exact lowest-level surface, fine-grained below the level of `BoxNode` for example

And then for click-to-select we use the top-level id, and for
targeted fillets we use the bottom one.

Also if you right-click somewhere and add a new object, it could maybe
make half an effort at placing the object in the place where you clicked.

## Highlight on hover

It would be cool to highlight the objects on hover. We could give
the shader a uniform to say the `uniqueId` under the cursor, and any
pixels that land on that `uniqueId` get coloured brighter or
something?

Nice, working. I made it mix in a green colour if the hit surface is
the same a the hovered surface.
