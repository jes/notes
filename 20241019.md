## John Harrison and his Timekeepers

I scanned this book in today: https://incoherency.co.uk/interest/john-harrison-and-his-timekeepers.pdf

Scanned at pretty low res because my scanner is quite slow and takes time proportional to the resolution, but perfectly
readable I'd say.

The "plates" (apart from the first one with teh pic of Harrison) are scanned at a higher resolution.

And then after each page was scanned I rotated and cropped it in Gimp, and then put them all together as a PDF.

Still needs OCR.

I tried "pdf24" OCR, but it did a really bad job.

## CAD model of house

I want to try and make some progress on the CAD model of the house.

Weirdly, FreeCAD is performing much worse than I would have sworn it did with the old graphics card. Is it just because I'm using
3 screens now instead of just one?

It seems to be super fast as long as I keep the window small enough, so could just be a shortage of GPU RAM? According to `nvtop`,
`xdg-desktop-portal-gnome` is using 42% of GPU RAM, 5.2 GB. Is that reasonable?

Seems like not! https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/xdg-desktop-portal-gnome/-/issues/118

After running `systemctl restart --user xdg-desktop-portal-gnome` indeed the GPU RAM is freed up, but still FreeCAD is super laggy.

Turning off multi-sampling anti-aliasing has solved it.

Tonight I've done the chimneys and made a start on the roof piece that goes over the kitchen.

Still need:

 * tile texture on kitchen roof
 * join up chimney holes for main chimney?
 * implied brick texture on walls?
 * boxing around pipes?
