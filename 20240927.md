## Sovereign scales

Paul said that he wouldn't mind the device being quite a bit bigger, and having a spot for a quarter sovereign is a new feature
not available elsewhere, so let's just make it bigger and add a slot for it, and then today I want to make a first prototype.

I don't have a 1mm end mill just yet, so might have to make do without the slot for now.

I'm going to go with this:

And then see how much of a counterweight it needs, and consider changing the dimensions accordingly. I'm guessing it will
need more counterweight than I have provision for, so I'll need to either make the left-hand side of the beam longer, or make the
base thicker to accommodate a longer weight.
