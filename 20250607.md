So the idea is you sight along the straight edge of the protractor, lining the 2 sights up with one object, and then angle the mirror until the sights are also lined up with the second object, and then the angle shown on the protractor is half the angle between the two objects (because mirror).

It is an issue if one of the directions is particularly brighter than the other, because then you only see the brighter direction.

I guess for navigating by the stars this wouldn't be a problem.
