## Barrel gear

I glued the barrel gear back on to the superglue arbor and proceeded cutting teeth. It flicked off
again, I glued it on again, it flicked off again, I glued it on again, and it flicked off for a third
time and flew across the garage and I don't know where it went.

In any event, there had been so many false starts that the teeth were all different shapes anyway, so
nothing of value was lost.

However, I am confused about why it kept flicking off. This process was pretty reliable before, wasn't it?
Is it because the weather is colder?

Maybe the answer is the same as when I was struggling with superglue workholding on the router:
I should cut the teeth before parting off. It will waste a lot more material, but **it's better to
waste material than time**. Need to remember that.

So I tried again using a piece of solid bar:

Great success.
