Printed a bracket to mount the binocular microscope on the lathe carriage.

Made a minimal testcase to show my issue with Matter.js and reported on github: https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/issues/1240 https://incoherency.co.uk/matterjs-test-case/

But actually, having made that test case, maybe that is an easier place to construct a model of the pallets, and then
when I get it to work without the erratic movements I can just copy it back to the main simulator project.

Last night I was thinking about making the pinions for the watch, and I'm not really sure how I'm going to hold the shafts on the 4th axis, far enough
away from the chuck that my gear cutter can reach them without hitting the chuck. Maybe I need like a "steady-rest" behind it to react the cutting forces,
and then I can have it sticking out a long way without worrying about bending it.

Problems still unsolved on the watch project:

* pivot polishing

* 4th-axis concentricity

* cutting pinions

* making the pivots in the plates

* designing an escapement

* cutting the internal teeth on the barrel

* affixing the mainspring to the barrel

* affixing the hairspring to the plate and balance wheel

Let's go and look at re-cutting the register on the 4th axis...
