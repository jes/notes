## Clock

I'm going to move the clock experiments into the office, because it's warmer and more convenient.

And since I can't hang the suspension spring from the ceiling in here, I'm going to have to make the frame hold it, which will
probably be a good thing anyway.

Here's a design with a spring suspension bolted to the frame: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5578

And with this configuration it looks to be just about working:

It is sustaining an amplitude of only about 120 degrees.

That's with 2x flanged stainless M6 nuts for drive weights.

I think with 3 nuts it flutters and with 1 nut it won't run, but haven't checked very thoroughly.

I think I've worked out that my suspension spring is not stiff enough. It's working now because I've been able to bring the balance wheel
up much closer to the rest of the mechanism, but it ticks about once every 2.5 seconds, I want it much slower than this.

Improvements to make:

 * reduce the gap between the forks
 * make it so I can access the bolts on the fork without twisting the wire
 * stiffer suspension spring
