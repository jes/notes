## Surface ids

The solution to the "bulging blends" problem:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6148

is to make Box's out of Intersections of half-spaces, and then we can apply blends between
individual pairs of half-spaces:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6149

Current hacky implementation is on the "half-spaces-fiddle" branch, with issues:

 * hover/select on the cube surfaces doesn't work
 * blend ids hardcoded
 * surface ids change every time the scene is recompiled
 * ignores the Box's `radius` parameter
 * Box distance field is now wrong

So I want to solve these issues.

For surface ids changing every time the scene is recompiled, perhaps the `BoxNode` initialises
its 6 HalfSpaces and its Intersection when it is *constructed*, and always returns the same
ones in `makeNormalised()`? And `makeNormalised()` just needs to set the sizes etc.

I could tolerate losing the `radius` parameter, as long as blending all the surfaces works.

How could hover/select on cube surfaces work? We kind of need to return 2 different ids:
one for the surface you're on, and one for the object that that surface belongs to.

Hovering on a face of the cube will yield the id of that surface. So we need
`document.findNodeById(...)` to come up with the BoxNode if you give it an id that belongs
to one of the BoxNode's HalfSpaces.

We could make `uniqueIds()` return the ids of all the HalfSpaces? And make `findNodeById()`
look in `uniqueIds()` for extra ids?

And to fix the distance field... how is it actually different now to what it was before?

Now it is `max()` of 6 "half-spaces" which are all like:

    p.x-halfSize

And previously it was:

    d = abs(p)-halfSize
    vlength(vmax(d, vec3(0,0,0)) + min(max(d.x,d.y,d.z), 0)

I don't immediately understand why this works off the top of my head. But thoughts are:

1. can we make Intersection/HalfSpace detect when they're perpendicular or whatever and automatically do the box distance field thing as a special case?
2. can we make it automatically work for any perpendicular surfaces, so that it does the right thing on cylinders and extrusions too?
3. can we make it work in the general case even on non-perpendicular surfaces? (my guess is no)

If the point is inside the box, `vmax(d, vec3(0,0,0))` gives you `vec3(0,0,0)` because `d` is
negative where inside and positive outside. And then `min(max(d.x,d.y,d.z), 0)` gvies you
the coordinate which is closest to the surface. Which is what you want.

If the point is outside the box, `vmax(d, vec3(0,0,0))` gives you 0's for coordinates
that are within the footprint of the box, and distance to the box surface for other
coordinates. So then `vlength()` of that gives you the distance to the nearest edge or
surface or corner. And `min(max(d.x,d.y,d.z), 0)` will be 0 if any of the coordinates are
positive.

So the Intersection is `max(d.x,d.y,d.z)`. `min()` with 0 just masks that out for
points outside the shape.

So the way it works is we decide whether the point is inside or outside. If inside,
take `max()` of 6 half-spaces. If outside, take the length of the axes that are outside
their respective half-space.

So how do we generalise that?

By defining:

    union(a,b) = max(min(a,b),0) - length(vec2(min(a,0), min(b,0)))
    intersection(a,b) = min(max(a,b), 0) + length(vec2(max(a,0), max(b,0)))

We get:

Which is obviously not *quite* right, but it's almost there!

Actually, it *is* exactly right, until we start applying blends. If I remove the blends
then I get this:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6151

So, why does adding blends affect it? Obviously it leads to rewriting the tree, but why
is that a problem? The `union()`/`intersection()` functions are ignoring the blend radius.
I guess they no longer distribute over each other when we're adding on the lengths?

Forget it for now, come back to it.

So we need `findNodeById()` to look in `uniqueIds()` (which btw should probably be called
`surfaceIds()` or something). And then we also need to track which particular surface id
is hovered, so that we can highlight the right one.

We can highlight the right surface by highlighting `renderer.rayMarchResult.uniqueId`.

How do we allow selection to handle both a selected surface and a selected object?

"Add blend" needs to add it to the surface, everything else needs to work with the object.

Working, super cool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOvqdlDbkBs

Kind of a bad video because it seems to have dropped some frames at crucial times so it
looks like I clicked on the wrong thing.

There is obviously some issue with the chamfer. And it doesn't manage to add a blend that
intersects with an existing blend.

The only remaining issues from the "half-spaces-fiddle" thing are that BoxNode no longer
respects its radius, and the distance field of a Box is now broken.

Can I implement "radius" by just setting the `blendRadius` on the `IntersectionNode`?
Yes, looks like it, although it interacts badly with targeted blends:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6153

The upper right one has a 1mm radius on the Box. The other one has no radius on the Box,
but there is a targeted blend between the two boxes.

The bad chamfer was caused by using too much sharpness on `chmax`. I've put it back down
from 0.98 to 0.90 and the problem is gone. Kind of not ideal to have rounded chamfers
though.

Maybe we don't care too much about cubes having broken distance fields? As long as they
work consistently it's probably fine. And if you do an Offset and the corners are sharp and
you want round ones, just fillet it afterwards?

I've merged "half-spaces-fiddle" into master because this is definitely how I want it to
work.

One issue is that when you select a Box in the tree it no longer highlights it on the
3d view, because it would need to select the surface ids instead of the Box id. Also
we don't support multiple select. How would you do that?

Have the SDF struct propagate up a field saying whether it is hovered and whether it is
selected. And then you can hover/select either individual surfaces or compound objects, and
multiple select works as well.

The field of the struct would be filled in by `treenode.js` in `peptide()` or whatever,
and would be a constant value either 0 or 1 based on whether the object is selected.
And combinators would propagate up the "selected" value of the chosen surface.
Actually it would be a *uniform* that gets set to either 0 or 1 based on whether the object
is selected.

But, kick that can down the road. I think this is an acceptable solution for "blends bulge out
on parallel surfaces".

I wonder if I can look at the individual object normals to work out how much of the "length"
thing to do, to fix the distance field? So instead of making them perpendicular and taking
the length, I should multiply each one by its gradient, sum them, and take the length of
the result?

## Secondary object

The secondary object is no longer working, and I can't quite remember why.

It's because of the normalisation and tree rewriting thing. I just need to copy the
"processedDocument" logic to "processedSecondaryNode" or something.

Hmm, still not quite working right. In the mode where it shows the field cross section it looks
right, but when it is meant to show a red transparent object, it is just drawing a transparent
white rectangle over the entire screen.

Ah! It was missing the `lipschitz` field in the struct. Sorted now.

And now it is irksome that the secondary object doesn't show up in the right place.
How do we fix that? Collect up all of the `Transform` nodes between it and the root
and apply them anyway? Or the more general thing I used to have where each node can
declare whether it needs to apply to the secondary?

Also when the mouse hover goes off the selected object it somehow gets unselected?

Ah, that's only for boxes. It's because it unselects the node if the selected node
does not exist in the tree. Why doesn't the selected node exist in the tree?

Oh! Because it doesn't report its own `surfaceId` in `surfaceIds()`!

Good, fixed now.
