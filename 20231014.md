## mk-pivot

The toolpath it generates looks like this, from the end: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4824

I'm not sure if I should be concerned that the "middle" ring of lines there doesn't appear
circular? Need to try it out and see how it looks. Is the trigonometry wrong?

Well I got this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4825

Looks quite good! Better than the previous attempts. The shoulder looks tapered in that microscope
pic, but with the loupe it doesn't look so bad.

The concentricity is not perfect but is better than before.

One issue is that the rotation speed of the A axis is really slow during the cut. I think it is because
the 30-degree angle increment means it maxes out LinuxCNC's look-ahead before it can reach the
programmed speed. Bit annoying, but not the end of the world.

I am going to keep using this method of making pivots for the time being, not least because it is really
the only way I have to make them anywhere near concentric, given my homemade 1mm collet.

## Balance wheel

Let's try and make a balance wheel next.

I'm using an "adaptive" strategy for the bit in the middle: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4826

With 2mm tool, 150mm/min feed, 50% stepover, 0.5mm stepdown, 1.5mm final depth. Not sure if this will take too long.

The tool broke before I even got to the adaptive part.

So maybe 0.5mm stepdown is too aggressive for it. I don't have another 2mm tool sadly. I have some 3mm ones,
I'll try the same feeds and speeds but with a 3mm tool, and tidy up the internal radii with 1mm if I'm not
happy with it.

I've ordered a packet of 10 replacement 2mm 1-flute tools from Amazon for Â£15. Not sure if that is a wise
investment, but Rennie Tool is out of stock of up-cutting 2mm 1-flutes, so worth a punt.

Update: I used 50% feed override mostly, because the 3mm tool was down-cutting. I also used a low-pressure
air blast from the compressor, which worked *so* well I can't believe I haven't been using it before. I need
to rig up something to hold an air nozzle so that I don't have to do it by hand.

Making the balance wheel was the same procedure as before: machine it, drill the holes, part off, superglue arbor, face to length, sand, clean.

I haven't polished this one (yet?) as the faces are too difficult to get to.

The process for these parts is pretty reliable. Very good. The worst part is probably the bit where I have to burn the superglue off,
I always feel like I'm damaging the surface finish, both with the flame and with whatever tool I use to see if the glue bond is loose.
Maybe I need some soft but heat-resistant tweezers?

## Balance wheel shaft

I'm going to use the test pivot from `mk-pivot` earlier for one end, but cut the piece of rod to 12mm length, and use
`mk-pivot` again to put a pivot on the other end.

The shaft itself was fairly straightforward, although I am having trouble with:

* cutting the pins to the correct length
* installing wheels on shafts at the correct position
* perpendicularity of shafts
* press-fits coming loose

So maybe I need to just accept that glue will be required and the press-fits are not adequate. Maybe I need to go to
the trouble of chucking the pins in the lathe and turning to length. And maybe I need to make some special fixtures
that let me tap the shafts into the correct positions.

Also, I managed to twist the frames while trying to undo the bolts without using the vice :(. Sad times.

The impulse pin fits in the pallet fork slot, and the balance wheel and pallet fork interact nicely, so that's good!

But I have the axial positions all wrong, so the pallet pins don't engage the escape wheel. And there is also nowhere
near enough room for a collet/hairspring.

But this is some progress.

## Next

Print out some sort of technical drawing showing the axial locations on all the shafts, lengths of pins, etc.,
and then write instructions for making:

* jigs to facilitate pressing things onto shafts at the correct positions
* the press-fits tighter
* the pins the right length
* the shafts perpendicular
