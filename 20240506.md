## Machine building

Still todo is:

 * get shorter screws for bolting to linear rail carriages (48x)
 * assemble Z axis
 * assemble the frame
 * motor mounts
 * hook up to LinuxCNC for first tests?
 * square up all the axes, put epoxy putty (?) filler on the gantry mounts
 * mark & drill for the gantry back supports, put inserts in them, clean them up, bolt them on
 * install in laundry basket
 * fit spindle motor
 * get a VFD
 * replace LinuxCNC with grblHal

I thought I had already ordered shorter screws but I still don't seem to have them, need
to chase up. It says they were meant to have arrived on Friday, I've messaged GWR Fasteners
on eBay.

So let's start with assembling the Z axis.

Oops!

I accidentally drove the ballnut past the end of its screw, 3 of the balls fell out and the
seal came off. I will have to reassemble this ballnut.

Well 3 balls came out but I'm having trouble getting any more than 2 back in. There doesn't
seem to be room on the outer track for the 3rd ball. It must have come from this track
because I can't imagine either of the other tracks got exposed. But maybe? The question is
do I assemble it 1 ball short, or do I unscrew it further and see if I can get a ball in
the middle track, but risk making it even more than 1 ball short?

I think risk it. I already know I've successfully rebuilt this ballnut once already.

Meh, too fiddly, I can't do it. I'd have to fully disassemble it and I can't be bothered.
So I'm just going to assemble it 1 ball short.

That'll do.

Must remember: there is basically 0 tolerance for over-travel on the Z axis.

Next up: assembling the frame?

Looking good!

The uprights splay apart slightly, I think this is due to the inserts on the baseplate
sticking out, so if you tighten the lower bolts more it makes the top move out, and
if you tighten the upper bolts more it makes the top move in. Not sure whether I'll just
live with this or whether I'll file it all flat. It might be helpful if I can use
this property to square up the machine and have the gap filled with epoxy putty?

So next up is bolting the gantry to the uprights, which will require hole locations
transferred to the uprights and then holes drilling and inserts gluing in.

Then once that is set and all bolted up nicely, I can fit the gantry back pieces. Although
I'm not necessarily in a hurry to do that just yet, I can do it just as easily at any time
before installing it in the laundry basket. Which, incidentally, I'm not sure how I'm going
to do. It is very heavy.

Apart from the above list, things that still need doing are:

 * bolt gantry to uprights
 * drill holes for bolting to metal stand

## Motorbiking

I had my first enjoyable motorcycle ride so far this year. (The first time I got cold and wet, the second time the battery was flat and I
had to take the car).

I had the idea to make a "motorcycling forecast", it will basically be a weather forecast but it draws a picture of a motorbike
on days that will be pleasant motorcycling weather. I basically just want to be warm and dry. I also want dry *roads*, so it's
no good for it to just not be raining, I'd rather it hadn't substantially rained in the last day.

Today it is apparently 17 deg. C outside and I was quite comfortable, I probably want at least 14? And do I need
some sort of model of how long it takes roads to dry under different rain, temperature, and wind conditions?

ChatGPT said:

> Let:
>
>     P = hours since last significant precipitation
>     T = temperature in Celsius
>     H = relative humidity (%)
>     W = wind speed (km/h)
>     S = sunlight exposure (hours)
>
> Dryness Score=P+((T-10)/5)+(W/10)+S-(H/10)

And it says a score >15 indicates roads are dry, and <10 indicates roads are still wet.

What does that give us for today?

Let's say:

    P = 12
    T = 17
    W = 15
    S = 3
    H = 74

Then dryness score is 12 + ((17-10)/5) + (15-10) + 3 - (74/10) = 12 + 1.4 + 5 + 3 - 7.4 = 14. That's actually
not awful. The roads *were* slightly wet under the trees, so being just under 15 is probably fair.

I wonder if this formula is actually any good or if it's just a fluke? Maybe I'd rather display "mm of rain in last
24 hours" as that is then at least understandable.

It would be handy to have a dataset of historical weather readings and road wetness readings so that I could test
out the formula, and improve on it.

There is also scope for a slightly different "microlighting forecast", that needs:

 * dry
 * low wind
 * not too much cloud

Sources of weather data:

 * Met office: no obvious API
 * Accuweather: has a "free trial" API limited to 50 calls/day
 * Wunderground: looks like it *had* an API, but not obvious on the website any more, also not obvious whether the API has forecasts or only live data
 * METAR from Yeovilton (EGDY): live data, but no forecast

Scraping the data from the Met office web page may be the best option. They block `LWP::UserAgent`'s User-Agent string,
but changing it solves it. Eventually I'll include a URL to where they can see my tool.

An hour is potentially good for motorcycling if the temperature is 14 deg. C or above, and the sums of percentages of rain probability in the last 6 hours
and next 2 hours is less than 80. This would require us to store historical rain probabilities - however I think it is OK to just assume they were 0,
because I can look out the window to see if the roads are wet.

I have a script to scrape the date off the Met office page, they make quite good use of `data-...` attributes which makes it easier
than it could have been.

Made a start here: https://github.com/jes/weather - so far just `./grab | ./parse | ./motorcycling` and it will print "good" or "bad" based on
temperature only. I need to make it look backwards and forwards to see what precipitation looks like, and then do something similar for microlighting,
and make it generate a web page and run it on cron. Probably also store all the grabbed HTML so that in future I *will* have a historical dataset.

## Lawnmower

I tried the "Drop and Mow" on the top grass out the front, with this result:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5444

The problem is that the stone has some grass/weeds on it so the camera still thought it was driving on grass
all the way off the edge.
