## Tractor

I slotted the mounting holes for the motor and lay shaft, and tried to drive it.

The first thing that happened is the plywood mounting block for the lay shaft got ripped apart.

So then I glued it back together and added screws and tried again.

This time the pulley block bearings got twisted on the plywood block and the chains came off.

I think trying to do this stuff with wood is maybe too much trouble. I am thinking I will cut a big hole in the top of the chassis,
and make a metal plate that the motor bolts to. The lay shaft block will be made of metal and will bolt rigidly
to the plate. The plate will have slotted holes for mounting to the chassis, and will bolt through the chassis. And the motor
will mount to the plate through slotted holes.

## Quiz generator

So the plan is to set up some code to generate quizzes using LLMs. Obviously we give it a tool to let it
provide us with quiz questions. We ask it to give us a handful of questions, and keep asking it until we have
enough.

Then I think we use a second LLM to filter out questions that are obviously bad or duplicate. And if we then don't
have enough we go back to the first one and ask it for more.

And we can let the user provide study materials, or news articles, or any sort of source data, to generate questions
from.

And then once the generator is working, we can have a bot scrape news sites or something to come up with up-to-date
general knowledge quizzes.

But for now, let's just generate quizzes.

And then quiz outputs can be:

 * interactive web page, single-player
 * interactive web page, multiplayer on one device
 * interactive web page, but shared across multiple devices
 * printable PDF

OK, working. Current state is it makes interactive single-player quizzes on CLI. Doesn't yet look at source material, that
can come later.

I think next step is to make a single-player interactive web version. And maybe for some unpredictability we would want
to have hundreds of questions on each topic, and just show the player a randomly-selected 20 at a time?
