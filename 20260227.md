## Car engine mounts

The plan is to work out roughly where I want the bolt holes to be, and then machine slots in them, drill holes in the spacer block
for M8 clearance, bolt everything up, then tack the mounts in place with the engine bolted in, to make sure it fits, and then
weld in place.

I had trouble getting the holes to all line up while it was sitting in the chassis, so instead my solution was to bolt it up on
the bench and then hammer the angle iron parts into the chassis.

It may turn out that as soon as I unbolt it I won't be able to
get it to line back up again, in which case I will have to try to work out which direction to widen the slots. But that's
a problem for the future.

I've only tacked the angle iron pieces in place, just in case I still want to remove them. But probably I won't.

The yellow-zinc-plated clevis-looking part is for tensioning the chain. I think I want to use it, so the mounts for the gearbox
will be a couple of sheet metal bracket parts that pick up one of the holes on the gearbox and slot around the chassis rail and
get welded to the chassis, and then somehow another bracket nearby that the clevis-looking part can bolt through. With spherical
washers? Or what?

And then I'll use the clevis-looking part to tension the chain between the gearbox and the axle, and then slide the engine to
tension the chain from the engine to the gearbox. Annoyingly, sliding the engine means the exhaust will need to be able to move
on its mounts, but you can get flexible exhaust pipe so maybe that would be good to use.
