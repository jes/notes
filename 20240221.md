## Composite worktop offcuts

I did the same tapping test as the other day, except this time with M12. The result was the same.

For M8, M10, or M12, drill with the largest drill that is less than or equal to the nominal drill size.
For M12 I used a 10mm drill.

Then first tap with the smallest tap using the cordless.

Then tap with the middle-sized tap.

Then you can screw in a bolt. Tightening it up with the impact driver or a spanner won't strip the thread,
but it will strip relatively easily with the long breaker bar.

So perhaps I want to be getting threaded inserts and epoxying them into the material, instead of tapping it
directly? Or, where possible, bolt through it with a nut on the other side?

## Spindle motor

I've taken apart the 1.5kW spindle motor to see how easy it is to replace the bearings.

There are 2 bearings at the front, with a marking on the outer race to presumably show the intended
direction and order of the 2?

And 1 bearing at the rear, which is marked with the "larger" of those 2 markings.

And all 3 are marked "KH6002-2RZ CTNT/P4 DT CAA S" on the outer race and "1912" on the inner race.

Also marked "OUSRC" on the outer race, 180 deg. away from the "KH6002..." marking.
