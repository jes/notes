## Interval arithmetic

I think the way I'm going to do this is add two new types to Peptide:
"ifloat" and "ivec3", that do interval arithmetic.

And then some way to turn a straightforward expression into an interval
expression. You pass it something to say which of your variables will
transform into the interval equivalent (for me I think that is just `p`,
but no reason not to make it general).

Then DFS the tree and replace instances of those variables with the
interval equivalent, and when any node that expects non-interval
children has an interval child, it converts itself into the interval
equivalent. If you have one child that is an interval and one that is
regular, I guess you convert the regular one into a 0-sized interval first.

For a start I can just do some basic add/mul/sub/div of floats
and then write tests for it, and then expand until I can turn SDFs
into intervals.

Actually, a couple of other thoughts are:

 * we can transform *all* nodes into interval equivalents, and then transform the interval version back into a regular version that implements it, and then common subexpression elimination will automatically solve what needs to be intervals and what needs to be regular?
 * we could skip any transformation into an interval form and just add a second set of closures that implement the interval version

I think the latter might be easiest, but it will unnecessarily do
interval arithmetic even on subtrees that consist entirely of 0-sized
intervals.

But premature optimisation is bad. I think let's do it this way.

OK, I have it passing quite a lot of tests with interval arithmetic.
Not all of them.

`smin()`/`smax()` have divisions by intervals that cross 0, not sure
what is wrong there. And `mvmul()` is not implemented yet so tests that
use it can't work.

I am making `float`s and `vec3`s use intervals, but matrices are staying
as plain `mat3`s because matrices are only ever allowed to
be constants or input variables. You can't construct matrices using
Peptide, which means they never need to contain intervals.

Once all the tests are passing with interval arithmetic, I will want
to do the "compiled JavaScript" version of interval arithmetic, and
finally "compiled GLSL". And then I can make the shader do binary
searching over intervals! And then I can make min/max skip paths that
can't contribute to the interval.

OK, all tests now passing!

Next up is the "compiled JavaScript" version.

OK, done, pretty straightforward, one issue is that the
trigonometric functions behave pretty weirdly in interval arithmetic.

I think uniquely, they don't necessarily reach min/max at the min/max
of the operands.

OK, I now have interval arithmetic for sin/cos, and the compiled JS
code is passing the tests.

Last thing is compiled GLSL interval arithmetic code, and then a
binary search ray marching shader.

OK, I've also worked out that modulo is more complicated than I thought.

Currently the only place modulo is used is in the cubic lattice,
is there a way to ditch it? Although I would probably also want to use it 
for domain repetition.

Meh, I probably want mod, I'll just do it. There's also the issue of how
to handle modulo with negative values. I'm hoping to simply avoid taking a view
on it, and then later on either take a view whenever I need to, or just
ossify whatever happens by default.

OK, great success! All tests passing in interval mode, with direct evaluation,
compiling to JS, and compiling to GLSL.

So now I need to write an interval mode binary search interval ray marching renderer.

First I guess I can duplicate the mouse cursor coordinate code using binary
search interval ray marching, and verify that it is giving the same answers.

One issue is that the interval thing tells you if the ray *might* hit the surface within
the interval, it doesn't tell you that it definitely will, especially if the scene gets
rotated.

So far I have standard ray-marching code using the interval SDF with 0-sized
interval, and plotting both results for the point under the cursor. It seems to
basically agree, but the interval code is a lot slower, it triggers the
performance logging quite often.

If I position the cursor right next to a flat surface, to max out the number of
steps, then the standard code takes 12ms for 500 steps and the interval code
takes 99ms. So maybe about 9x slower. But since we will be able to do a lot less
than 9x as many iterations in the worst case, this may be a winner anyway. And
then we get to do min/max pruning as well. I think for min/max pruning in the JS
version I will have the call pass a second hash map to the generated function
(one for the variables, like now, and one for the min/max state). And each min/max
call can check whether it can skip a branch, and can assign whether it *could have*
skipped a branch. I probably need to sleep on the actual implementation.

## Graph numbering

Given a directed graph, compute an integer that uniquely identifies that graph.
2 identical graphs should get the same Graph Number, and 2 different
graphs should get different Graph Numbers.

You need to be able to efficiently compute the Graph Number, and bonus
points if you can efficiently reverse it.

First idea:

 * label the nodes of the graph arbitrarily
 * compute the adjacency matrix
 * (add an additional column to the matrix containing just a single "1" to specify the number of nodes)
 * permute the matrix into a canonical form (can you sort the rows/columns somehow?)

Now you have an adjacency matrix that uniquely identifies the graph.

For each row, treat it as a binary number *n_i*, and accumulate
**2^n_0 + 3^n_1 + 5^n_2 + 7^n_3 + ...**, i.e. the Godel numbering of
the columns.

And then you have your Graph Number.

But it's difficult to reverse because you need to find the prime
factorisation.

So the next idea is to use "variable-base numbering" e.g. https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/chess-steg.html to convey first the size of the matrix, and then a bitstream for the contents of the matrix.

So the only issue is how you permute the matrix into a canonical form.

And then we have a mapping from graphs to integers, which also
proves that the set of graphs is not an uncountable infinity.

Apparently "nauty" has a scheme for canonical vertex labelling:
