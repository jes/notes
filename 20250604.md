## Sundial

Finally installed: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6193

The dial plate is screwed down to some pieces of aluminium, which are placed inside holes drilled in the
top of the column. If this proves insufficient, the plan is to pull it back off, put some glue in the holes,
and put it down again.

I think it is aligned with North pretty well, because I can sight down the line to Glastonbury Tor and it lines up well.
I haven't put a level on it yet so it is possible it is tilted. If that is the case, then I think glue the
aluminium pieces into the holes, and level it by putting shim washers on the low side.

I rubbed Vaseline on all the threads, so that they have half a chance of not corroding by the time I come to undo them.
