## G-code sender

Plan for today:

 * make a separate `Grbl.Realtime()` function for sending real-time commands
 * outside `Grbl.Realtime()`, enforce character-counting
 * review Grbl documentation to find a full list of real-time commands
 * detect real-time MDI inputs and handle differently?
 * mostly ignore the serial buffer size from Grbl, other than to increase the `SerialSize`
 * detect if the character count is out of sync, log a "BUG: ..." line
 * fix the toolpath view so that it doesn't jump around when work offset changes
 * fix keyboard input, feed-hold etc. seems to not be working
 * don't let a cancel of continuous jogging cancel the incremental jogging (need to make incremental jogging use absolute coords, and re-send them after cancelling the continuous jog, but watch out for making it do big incorrect jogs when the coordinate system changes)
 * split up toolpath rendering into background, toolpath, foreground
 * only re-render toolpath layers that have changed
 * combine straight-line toolpath segments into one (but remember the last half-segment will need rendering on its own)
 * allow editing the DRO
 * interaction hints

## Real-time commands

I've done most of the real-time stuff. There is still some syncing issue where sometimes it will think Grbl has 3 bytes in the buffer when there are none.
This is almost certainly a `$G\n` that didn't get a reply, but I'm not sure why. I've made it not send `$G\n` until after the first status report,
which should mean it doesn't send `$G\n` until Grbl is ready to respond to it. So not sure what needs fixing there, leaving it for now.

Looking at the toolpath view jumping around when changing work offset... it looks like the Grbl MPos is changing by more than I expect.
If my current WPos is at X0 and I change it to X-1, I think that should only affect WPos and WCO, I don't think MPos should change. But in
fact MPos changes by 2mm! What is going on there? Am I computing MPos wrong, or is Grbl?

OK, I had `MPos = WPos - WCO`, that is wrong, it should be `MPos = WPos + WCO`. Fixing usage of the WCO, plus making it compute velocity
based on MPos instead of WPos, seems to have sorted everything out.

## Jogging

Now the jogging thing. The issue is that when you do a series of taps for an incremental jog, we send them as `G91` relative movements.
If you then do a continuous jog in another axis, then that aborts the relative movements.

Why? Because at the start of a continuous jog we send a jog cancel, so that if you start a continuous jog of a second axis it takes
effect immediately instead of waiting for the planner buffer to empty.

But maybe that's not necessary any more now that the jog movements are so short? Let's just try *not* sending a jog cancel when you start a
continuous jog and see if that solves it.

OK, no, that's no good. The problem is if you send a series of incremental jogs, and then start a continuous jog, we want the continuous jog
to start executing immediately, but it actually doesn't start until the incremental jogs are complete. So we definitely need a jog cancel
at the start of a continuous jog. And we also need to do incremental jogs in absolute coordinates.

If incremental jogging was all we had to do, we could initialise the jog target to WPos, and whenever you do an incremental jog we just add
the jog increment to the relevant axis in the jog target, and send a jog cancel and a `G90` absolute movement to the new jog target.

The problem now is that we still do want to support continuous jog, and we also want to support movements entered via the MDI.

When you press a key for an incremental jog, there are several possible states:

 * the axis is at rest
 * the axis is moving due to an MDI command
 * the axis is moving due to queued incremental jogs
 * the axis is moving due to a recently-aborted continuous jog

If the axis is at rest, then we can take the current WPos as the start point. If the axis is moving due to queued incremental jogs
then we must not change the start point. If the axis is moving due to a recently-aborted continuous jog or an MDI command then the end point is
indeterminate, and I'd say it's OK to take the current WPos as the start point.

Maybe in the jog control loop, we check periodically whether the velocity is 0, and if so, we update the jog start point to be the current
WPos. And whenever we hit an incremental jog key, we add the increment to the target and send a jog cancel, `G90` absolute jog to
new target, and restart continuous.

So now the issue is that if the velocity never reaches 0 and we try to do an incremental jog, we'll send that axis off to an uncontrolled distance
in an uncontrolled direction.

Another issue is that if we do an incremental jog while a continuous jog is running, the continuous jog stops while the incremental movement
takes place, because of how the planner works. So do we need continuous jogs to use absolute coordinates as well?

Another issue is that when we send the first incremental jog command, the velocity is still zero, and at the next tick we reset the jog
target back to the start, undoing the first incremental jog. That jog does execute if we now do nothing, so it does apply, but multiple
keypresses means the first increment is lost and every series of incremental jogs is one increment short of what it should be.

Oh well, this is actually really hard. I have made it always use absolute coordinates, and both incremental and continuous jogging by updating
the target coordinates, and resetting Target to Wpos whenever the axis is stationary for too long. It has the issue that if the "stationary
for too long" timer is too short, then it fires when a jog is just about to start, and if it's too long then it doesn't fire and out-of-date
targets are applied.

I'm leaving it for now. It's not obvious that the new failure modes are better than the old ones though.

## Toolpath rendering

Next up: splitting up toolpath rendering into separate layers.

Straightforward enough for now, there is obviously more that could be done though:

 * when a new point in a straight line is added, we could replace the previous point instead of appending a new one,
   slightly complicates the drawing code though
 * we could make the toolpath layer big enough to contain all the points, and then when it is panned without zooming
   we could simply draw it at different coordinates instead of redrawing the whole thing
 * when panning/zooming, while waiting for the new frame to render, we could render the old frame but shifted and scaled
   to match what the new frame will be

This will do for now though. A good compromise between efficiency and simplicity. And it will be nice and easy to insert 
an extra layer showing the loaded G-code.

## DRO editing

I want to be able to click on a DRO element, or type its letter ("X") and enter a mode where I am editing the DRO values.

I want to be able to type:

 * any numbers to set the absolute value
 * "/2" to divide it by 2 (possibly arbitrary arithmetic here, but if a leading
   binary operator is used in unary context it implicitly takes the current value as its first argument)

and press enter to commit.

While typing I want to see:

 * the current value
 * what I'm typing
 * the evaluation of what I'm typing

I don't want it to bugger up the flow of the GUI, I want it to appear in a floating layer next to the thing I'm editing.
And I probably want to be able to use the same type of editor for other things (jog increment and jog feed rate, for starters).

So maybe, in implementation order:

 * detect when the user wants to edit the value (either by clicking or by a keypress)
 * enter the "DRO" (or better name) mode, supplied with the current value, the location to draw the editor at, and maybe a callback to apply the updated value
 * in the DRO mode, draw a box at the given location to verify it's working
 * draw the current value in the box
 * put an auto-focused input field in the box
 * automatically cancel if you press escape, or click off the input field
 * apply the new value if you submit
 * draw the editor.Text() value next to the box
 * evaluate arithmetic
 * show the evaluted value below the box
 * make it pretty

And then test it:

 * what if you drag the toolpath while editing the DRO?
 * what if you resize the DRO?
 * what if you resize the window?
 * what if you change the font size?
 * what if you enter the editor while in MDI mode and then apply the new value?
 * what if you enter from MDI mode and then cancel?
 * what if you disconnect while editing?
