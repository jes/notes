## Clock

Yesterday I wrote a load of nonsense about the clock, but I think I reached this as a sketch of
the design:

 * ordinary drive weight, with no maintaining power
 * Korfhage remontoire directly driving the escape wheel
 * anti-friction rollers on the escape wheel
 * H4-like escapement: verge-like, with "deadbeat" backs of pallets, and spiral balance spring
 * steel box section frame
 * belt-drive or chain-drive going from the going train to the motion work
 * maybe a seconds hand on the escape wheel (it's ok if this takes N minutes to do a rotation, just do the "quarter dial" thing like in Hefetrueb's clock)

For gearing:

 * drive shaft does 50 rotations per year
 * escape wheel does 1 rotation per 4 minutes
 * so we need 1:2880 from the drive shaft to the escapement

And for the rest:

 * remontoire shaft is inline with escape wheel shaft and turns at the same speed
 * there is an extra shaft even faster than the remontoire shaft (4x? 8x?) that has the arm to catch the remontoire lever, and a fly

For bearings:

 * drive shaft: pillow block bearings bolted to the steel frame
 * the next 2 shafts have ball bearings of reducing size
 * remontoire shaft has plain pivots maybe 1mm
 * remontoire adjacent shaft can have plain pivots
 * the remontoire lever arm can be on its own plain bearing, maybe sliding on the shaft that powers the remontoire.
 * escape wheel sits on anti-friction rollers
 * the balance wheel can have conical pivots
 * the motion work can have small ball bearings, similar to the stepper motor clocks

So the plan is to lay out the clock in sort of schematic form in FreeCAD and see that it looks like it is going to work,
and then as quickly as possible transition to making the escapement. Once the escapement works we'll know how fast it ticks,
then the gear train can be recalculated and I can build the rest of the clock.

For making bevel gears for the remontoire I wanted to use https://github.com/looooo/freecad.gears but I can't install
it in the addon manager because of some git error about not being able to find "master" (but I checked on github and it is
still using "master" and not "main"). And when I tried to install it again it is saying it is already installed and up to date,
but the workbench isn't visible anywhere.

If we allow 7-tooth pinions then to get 1:2880 we can use `7:105 7:98 7:96`. One problem is there is no simple ratio
to take the minute hand off this. The second shaft is quite close, takes about 54 mins per rev.

Here's a way to lay that out: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5703

That shows the going train, from the drive weight (represented by the tall thin rectangle) to the escape wheel, and including
the shaft adjacent to the remontoire.

Does *not* show the motion work, balance, anti-friction rollers.
