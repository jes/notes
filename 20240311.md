## LLM tree search

I read something about using tree search to get better output from LLMs. I don't know what the other
person's plan was, but I'd like to have a play. My plan is instead of taking (for example) the highest-probability
token at each point, and then building a straight line like that, we'd take the N highest-probability "root" words,
and recurse for M levels, and at the end of the M levels we'd work out which string has the highest probability
overall, and output the root word that leads into that subtree, throw away all the other subtrees,
evaluate the N highest-probability leaf words for the chosen subtree, choose the new root word that leads to
the highest probability string, etc.

So after you've spun up the initial tree, generating a single token takes **O(M^N)** times as much work as before,
i.e. you need to evaluate a new set of leaf nodes each time. My guess is you'd want to make M high and N small.
Perhaps you'd even want to make N vary (i.e. try all the most likely tokens that add up to a probability in
excess of some value, instead of always taking the same number of tokens).

Using Karpathy's Python GPT tutorial implementation, trained on my blog, before was:

Not obvious that there's much improvement.

## Machine design

I'm going to put all of the holes in the frame parts for: BK12, ballnut holders, HGR15, carriages.

My threaded inserts are:

 * M4: 22mm length, 5mm outside diameter
 * M6: 30mm length (plan to cut in half and turn to 14mm), 10mm outside diameter

The eBay listing says the outside diameters are "approximate", so I may have to measure them once they arrive.

It also says the M4x22mm ones are only "part threaded", if that is a problem I may have to tap them, could be
very annoying. Possibly I'd rather get shorter bolts than tap 48 threaded inserts.

I've put in holes for the HGR15 rails on the X and Z axes (don't know spacing yet for Y), but I'm wondering
if I actually shouldn't drill all these holes upfront, and instead drill only the 2 endpoints for one rail
and 1 endpoint for the other. Then bolt the first rail in with the endpoints, and transfer & drill the actual
observed hole positions for the rest of the first rail. Then bolt the second rail in with only one end point,
and slider an indicator along to put the second end the same distance away, and then transfer & drill the
actual observed hole positions for the rest of the second rail. That way I know I can get them parallel and
make sure the holes line up.

The other option is to rely on the CNC router to drill the holes in the right place, and I can always
widen the holes in the rails if I end up needing more adjustment, which I would expect not to. I think easier
to do this and hope for the best.

Well I've got all the holes in place and so far no collisions.

Some of the X carriage holes will live under the Z axis rails:

But I think I can live with that. It does mean that the Z axis rails have to come off if I ever need to take
the X axis carriages off.

What's more trouble: have the X carriage bolts underneath the Z rails? Or move the X carriages further apart so
that the rail runs down the middle?

I think if I have room to do the latter I should do that. I think it's OK if the carriages overhang the plate, as long
as the bolts go through the plate.

Plenty of room: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5359

So the only remaining missing holes are the ones for the spindle clamp, for bolting the frame plates together,
and the counterbores for the flange-headed bolts.

The spindle clamp is definitely going to cover the bolts of the lower Z carriages, but there's not a lot I can do
about that:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5360

If I'm taking those carriages off I'll need to re-tram the spindle clamp anyway, so I don't think that's
a big deal.

According to the eBay listings for the bolts:

* M4: flange diameter 9.4mm, head depth including flange 2.2mm
* M5: flance diameter 11.8mm, head depth including flange 2.75mm

I'll go for counterbores of 11mm diameter 3mm depth, and 13mm diameter 4mm depth.

Counter-bores in place: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5361

Next tasks:

 * motor mounts
 * Y rail holes
 * spindle clamp holes
 * frame plate holes

Annoyingly all 3 motor mounts might have to be slightly different because they all ended up different
distances away from the adjacent frame plates.

I had a look at the M8 flanged bolts I have. They only have 25mm of thread so are not going to be suitable
for bolting frame plates together. I'll probably go for M6 flange-headed bolts with 40mm of thread.
