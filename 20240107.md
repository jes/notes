## Duplex escapement

Got a balance cock and a bridge in place: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5256

The total height is 11.25mm, but I could lose 1mm off the barrel thickness by making
the barrel surfaces 0.5mm instead of 1mm.

It occurred to me that I can press things onto shafts square by using the lathe! Put the shaft in the chuck
and a pusher in the tailstock, and use the tailstock to push the part onto the shaft.

Now with bridges, shafts, hairspring:

I think that's mostly it now, just missing the click/clickspring. And the adjustable cone pivot hole for
the balance, but I think I'll just turn that in the end of a grub screw, doesn't really need CAD.
(Famous last words).

Also missing a hole to pin the hairspring in.

Here's the plan for the balance shaft blank: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5258

The impulse pallet and locking roller will be machined directly onto the shaft.

What are my chances of successfully making this? Especially given that it has to be made out of soft
steel, because I don't have any silver steel with a 7mm+ diameter.

To turn the sharp shoulders I'm probably going to need to make my own lathe tools.

Maybe I'll go and have a first pass at making this part, with the expectation of scrapping it,
just so I know what I'm up against.
