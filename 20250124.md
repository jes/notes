I've put 2 more M12 bolts on the balance wheel, now has a period of about 7.5 seconds.

I also readjusted the balance pivots and the pallet angles, which were quite badly off.

It would definitely benefit from improved balance pivots that somehow locate more
positively. Since they're just located by a screw thread, there is a lot of wobble in them
every time you loosen them, so I am pushing it to one side before tightening the nut
to adjust the location in X/Y plane, which is not really ideal. It should be positively
located in X/Y and the screw should only move it up and down, and there should be a
separate adjustment for X/Y (which in the worst case could just be provided by the aluminium
extrusion).
