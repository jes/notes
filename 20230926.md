## Plan

Print out the guard dart system, make a longer spring, try it out, plot natural frequency of balance wheel
& isochronicity charts again.

Tidy the garage, clean the lathe, make a chip-guard for the back of the lathe.

CAD a Douzieme gauge, make it, blog it.

## Guard dart system

Well I printed it out but I couldn't wind a satisfactory hairspring by hand, so I designed
this hairspring winder based on one in the "Watch and Clock Making and Repairing" book:

The idea is you hook 3 pieces of wire to the inside of one piece, and feed them through the slots
in the other piece, and then rotate the pieces to coil the 3 wires up tightly together, and then you take
it apart and you've got 3 hairsprings. Will it work? I don't know. The most likely failure is that the
3d printing is not precise enough to properly constrain the 0.7mm wire.

I'm planning to drill a hole on the inside of each leg and bend up a bit of stainless wire to make
the spring. The pivot will be held together with an M3 bolt with a big washer, with one leg tapped, and maybe
loctited. I still need to make the engraving pattern for the scale.

It's meant to be made out of 3mm steel, but if I find that too annoying I may revert to aluminium.
