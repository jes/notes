## FreeCAD

So the latest on this is I have a version of FreeCAD
build and run from inside the `ubuntu-gpu` distrobox.

So then what do I want to do to it?

 * improve performance on pattern operations
 * improve performance on involute gears
 * have some way to cancel long-running operations

My sense is that pattern operations are kind of quadratic-time. If you imagine the
first one cuts a shape out of the body by intersecting it, and then the second one
has a more complicated body to intersect against, and the third one has an even more
complicated body to intersect against. Like if intersection is linear in the number of
faces or whatever, and each item of the pattern increases the number of faces by some
fixed amount, then the overall pattern operation is quadratic.

So maybe I start by doing a slow pattern operation with callgrind, and see where it is
slow?

FreeCAD is very slow in callgrind.

This is the object I'm using:

It is a rectangle padded up, then a circle pocketed in, and PolarPattern around Z axis.
And I exercise the patterning code multiple times by repeatedly clicking the "up" arrow
in the PolarPattern form to make it re-run the calculation with 1 more item each time.

Then eventually just close FreeCAD, then look in KCacheGrind.

Initial map is:

I think maybe too much of the profile was spent on startup time, so it's not highlighting
whatever is slow in patterning. According to ChatGPT I can launch with

    $ valgrind --tool=callgrind --instr-atstart=no bin/FreeCAD

And then use:

    $ callgrind_control -i on $pid

to start profiling. Let's give it a go.

Now we have:

From a quick look I think all the slow stuff is inside OpenCascade. Perhaps I need to
be building my own OpenCascade. And in fact this might be helpful: if I can work out
what it is doing with OpenCascade that is slow, then I can make a minimal test program
that does the same thing, and skip the whole FreeCAD layer entirely.

I have found the code that implements the PolarPattern feature, the important bit is
in `Transformed::execute()` in `src/Mod/PartDesign/App/FeatureTransformed.cpp`. There is
code that loops through all the "original tool shapes" and transforms them according to
the pattern and applies them again. So yes my earlier speculation about how it would
end up being quadratic time was basically right.

The quickest thing I can do is make it break the loop early if it gets a SIGHUP, and
then also make the GUI level fork a child process which just shows a window with a
single button on it which sends a SIGHUP.

And once the concept is proven we could maybe do the same thing but using threads instead
of forking, if it matters.

Another idea is to make this loop run a tick of the event loop on every iteration, not
sure if that is possible and then forget about threads.

But first: build it, and see if manually sending a SIGHUP interrupts the operation.

But somehow my distrobox is broken now. `cmake` wasn't installed, I think because I had
already built FreeCAD by the time I created the GPU distrobox, so I only installed
the runtime dependencies, but now if I try to install `cmake` I get:

    jes@ubuntu-gpu:~$ sudo apt install cmake
    ...
    You might want to run 'apt --fix-broken install' to correct these.
    The following packages have unmet dependencies.
     cmake : Depends: cmake-data (= 3.28.3-1build7) but it is not going to be installed
    E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt --fix-broken install' with no packages (or specify a solution).

    jes@ubuntu-gpu:~$ sudo apt --fix-broken install
    ...
    Unpacking cmake-data (3.28.3-1build7) ...
    dpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/cmake-data_3.28.3-1build7_all.deb (
    --unpack):
     unable to make backup link of './usr/share/cmake-3.28/Modules/Compiler/NVIDIA-CUDA.cmake'
     before installing new version: Invalid cross-device link
    dpkg-deb: error: paste subprocess was killed by signal (Broken pipe)
    Errors were encountered while processing:
     /var/cache/apt/archives/cmake-data_3.28.3-1build7_all.deb
    E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

Maybe the plan is to still use the old distrobox for building it and just use the GPU
one for running it? That works.

I tried making the signal handler set a `volatile int`, but it didn't seem to be working.

Claude suggested making it a `std::atomic` or something.

OK, I added some logging to say what the loop iterations are doing, and it looks like
it only does one iteration? I guess it is looping over the bodies that I'm cutting
away, so I am handling SIGHUP in the wrong place. There is a more-inner loop elsewhere.

It's `getTransformedCompShape`. This function is the one that iterates over your
transformations. So I need to make this one stop iterating if you get a SIGHUP,
and then make the function that calls it give up and return early if it got a SIGHUP.

Seems to be working!

And if the processing gets far enough that `getTransformedCompShape()` completes and
OpenCascade starts applying your transformation, then I guess there's nothing you can do?

I've switched to SIGUSR1.

Next up is making some sort of `zenity` UI pop up or something if it isn't finished
within a few seconds.

And maybe I could abstract this into some sort of "Abortable Operation" function,
instead of special-casing it in `FeatureTransformed.cpp`.

OK, so now we're at:

 * zenity doesn't work in my distrobox, and is a bad solution anyway
 * trying to get `FeatureTransformed.cpp` to launch a Qt dialog doesn't work because PartDesign is a standalone .so file that isn't linked with all the Qt widget stuff

So we either need to move the GUI creation stuff further up the call stack, or else
(better) run the pattern operation in a separate pthread or whatever so that we have the
option to cancel it and it doesn't block the GUI.

OK, I think I'm wrong about `getTransformedCompShape()` being the slow part. The slow part
is actually a single call into OpenCascade, which is much more annoying to cancel.

So the new plan is to try to get `FeatureTransformed.cpp` to do its work in a child
process and just send the resulting shape over a pipe.

And get `ViewProviderTransformed.cpp` to pop up a modal that kills the child process
if you click the abort button.

Wow, this is actually working. So good.

I need the modal to disappear on its own when the transformation is complete. And I
want the modal to not appear until a few seconds have passed, otherwise it's just
annoying and distracting.

OK, great, all working!

One regression is that we used to get more fine-grained info in error cases, but now
it is just "Child process failed".

And another is that it will be totally broken on Windows etc. I should move the
computation code into another function, and on Linux we call that function in the
child process, and on Windows we just call it directly pending any better ideas.

Also the comments are kind of not very good, need to address that when I'm done.

Annoyingly it's only working on fuse operations! It hangs on cuts. Not sure what is
wrong. If I can't fix it quite quickly I might just make a demo video of what I already
have on fuse operations, and open a draft PR.

Another issue is it looks like opening up the Transform dialog results in running the
calculation (at least) *twice*! We should definitely fix that.

Also it seems to do 2 cuts when you ask for 2 copies of the thing - but aren't you already
starting from a body that has 1 cut in it?

No, it's not a difference between cuts and fuses. It seems to be that it works if you're
just doing a pattern of 1 existing feature (i.e. rotating copies of the entire body?),
but doesn't work if you are just doing a pattern of one feature on to an existing
body.

Maybe if I try passing the shapes in over a pipe instead of accessing them directly in memory?

Ah! I think the problem might simply have been that I applied my changes from one repo to
a repo from a slightly different tip, and then copied the file back across, and there
actually were other changes to the same file in the mean time. Hopefully that's all
it was.

Nope :(. Still bad.

So now I'm trying serialising the shape before forking and then deserialising it after.
Not super hopeful though.

Yeah, still no good.

So the next thing to do is make sure I'm starting from the version that I pushed earlier,
and not just that one single file copied into a different tree.

Done that, still hangs. So what is the problem here?

So the next thing is:

 * move as much of the setup as possible to be before the fork
 * try to do the minimum change necessary to do the work in the parent without changing the structure
 * work out why the operations work in the parent but not the child
 * review all of the above and write down bugs I forgot about
