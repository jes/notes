## Clock

It stopped winding the remontoire quite quickly. I added a 5th drive nut and it seems to
wind OK now, but the clock had stopped running for some reason, with the remontoire
still wound. I set it going again and seems fine now, not sure what was wrong.

The historical data view still isn't working, now getting `null` as the answer for 
every time range.

The `readings` table is empty...

    Error writing to database: 12 values for 10 columns

Fixed and this time I have verified it is writing to the database.

It stopped again. I think there needs to be some axial locating feature for
the middle part of the remontoire, I think it is getting wedged too tightly
in the teeth of one of the gears.
