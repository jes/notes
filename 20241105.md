## Principles of Mr. Harrison's Time-keeper

This wants to be turned into an actual readable PDF, instead of a series of pictures in no particular
order, and interspersing English and French.

So the plan is to download all the pages and combine them into a PDF. Maybe include the French as well
but put it at the end.

In [2024-10-19](20241019.md) I said "after each page was scanned I rotated and cropped it in Gimp, and then put them all together as a PDF" - but sadly no info on how I did that. I recall it was with imagemagick convert? Also I used an Adobe PDF optimiser to shrink the file size.

Just:

    $ convert *.jpeg foo.pdf

And then use https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html

It looks like there are a few chapters (?) in this book (?) that are only available in French, that's
disappointing.

There is also a note on the inside cover saying it lacks pages 1 and 2 of the preface. That's also disappointing!

I might be able to transcribe the French and get a machine translation.

"w" is typeset as "vv", I wonder if "w" was conceived to be two consecutive "v"'s at the time, or if that is to
save having to make "w"'s?

A lot of the "s"'s are "f"'s instead.

I can see ligatures for:

 * ct
 * ff
 * ft

The first page is marked MDCCLXVII, which means 1767.

I started writing some commentary on this, but didn't get finished. The post is at 4400 words so far including the
transcription.

## Printing TPU

I printed a replacement handle for the laundry basket in TPU today. I bumped the temperature up on the default "TPU for AMS" profile from 230 deg. C to 245 deg. C. The surface finish got noticeably worse, and I noticed that the suggested printing temperature on the side of the spool is "190 - 230", so I probably won't do it again. I expect
the layer adhesion is improved though.
