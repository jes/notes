## Tractor

I took the motor-mounting plate off and straightened up the bearing blocks on the lay shaft and also added a spacer between them so that the
shaft can be tightened properly.

Went for a razz and the scraping and crunching and knocking noises are gone! So that's good. Much improved.

However it is still slow. I do wonder if my recollection of it being faster before is simply wrong? Maybe it was always very slow uphill?
And maybe this is just fine?

The motor is an "MY1016", I found this drawing online:

I'm not certain that it matches mine but it looks close and it's too much trouble to take mine off to measure it, so let's say that is correct.

If I can find a cheap motor that will bolt to the same mounts and place the sprocket in about the same place, then I may just buy it. Needs to
take 36v and give more than 350W.

Alternatively, since they sell these same motors with various voltage specifications - I wonder if it is possible to open it up and wire it
for a lower voltage so that at 36v it has more power? Or are they just supplied with different coils?

Probably just live with it being slow.

So what about the sliding seat & rear mudguards?
