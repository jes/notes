## FreeCAD progress updates with OCCT blog

I should write down what I learnt about providing progress updates with OCCT, before I
forget it.

First up I need to paste all my FreeCAD notes into ChatGPT and get it to highlight
the key points, in case I forgot any.

Then:

 * explain the principle
 * explain how my *current* PR works, upfront, so as not to muddy the waters any
more between my current PR and earlier versions.
 * maybe explain the actual process I went through and the problems I ran into
 * point out that I think they are making an error by not merging it because I don't think anyone is going to rearchitect FreeCAD to take computation out of the main thread, and while computation is on the main thread we may as well have the Abort dialog I have made
