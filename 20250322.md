## Interval arithmetic

I think the way I'm going to do this is add two new types to Peptide:
"ifloat" and "ivec3", that do interval arithmetic.

And then some way to turn a straightforward expression into an interval
expression. You pass it something to say which of your variables will
transform into the interval equivalent (for me I think that is just `p`,
but no reason not to make it general).

Then DFS the tree and replace instances of those variables with the
interval equivalent, and when any node that expects non-interval
children has an interval child, it converts itself into the interval
equivalent. If you have one child that is an interval and one that is
regular, I guess you convert the regular one into a 0-sized interval first.

For a start I can just do some basic add/mul/sub/div of floats
and then write tests for it, and then expand until I can turn SDFs
into intervals.

Actually, a couple of other thoughts are:

 * we can transform *all* nodes into interval equivalents, and then transform the interval version back into a regular version that implements it, and then common subexpression elimination will automatically solve what needs to be intervals and what needs to be regular?
 * we could skip any transformation into an interval form and just add a second set of closures that implement the interval version

I think the latter might be easiest, but it will unnecessarily do
interval arithmetic even on subtrees that consist entirely of 0-sized
intervals.

But premature optimisation is bad. I think let's do it this way.

OK, I have it passing quite a lot of tests with interval arithmetic.
Not all of them.

`smin()`/`smax()` have divisions by intervals that cross 0, not sure
what is wrong there. And `mvmul()` is not implemented yet so tests that
use it can't work.

I am making `float`s and `vec3`s use intervals, but matrices are staying
as plain `mat3`s because matrices are only ever allowed to
be constants or input variables. You can't construct matrices using
Peptide, which means they never need to contain intervals.

Once all the tests are passing with interval arithmetic, I will want
to do the "compiled JavaScript" version of interval arithmetic, and
finally "compiled GLSL". And then I can make the shader do binary
searching over intervals! And then I can make min/max skip paths that
can't contribute to the interval.
