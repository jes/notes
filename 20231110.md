## Stepper motor clock

I asked [on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/electrical/comments/17qtro6/whats_the_simplest_way_to_get_a_90degree_phase/)
about how to get a 90-degree phase shift in AC to drive my stepper motor. One person told me you need to use
a microcontroller, which means they totally missed the point. But two people told me you can use just a capacitor
to shift the phase. Is that right??

I tried it out in the [Falstad circuit simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/):

https://www.falstad.com/circuit/

The resistor represents the load, and you can see the two voltage plots at the bottom.
By playing around with the capacitance value I *was* able to shift the phase, but it seems
like the more the phase shifts, the lower the amplitude gets.

However in my application I think this is completely fine! So next things to try are:

 * switch back to the 6v transformer
 * power the other coil of the motor via a capacitor

I wonder if the centres of the coils being tied together will be a help or a hindrance?
Maybe need to try just driving "half" of each coil, and letting the common wire be common.

## Hefetrueb Harrison Clock

This video has an example of a clock made according to Harrison's principles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-wm39a6r_k

The guy in the video (Hefetrueb?) recommends the book [Harrison by Jonathan Betts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Harrison-Jonathan-Betts/dp/0948065818/ref=sr_1_1?crid=229Z7EE9M3T1R&keywords=harrison+jonathan&qid=1699587604&sprefix=%2Caps%2C305&sr=8-1)
which I've ordered, as well as [Perfecting the Harrison twin-pivot Grasshopper escapement by David Heskin](http://www.hsn161.com/HSN/Heskin2.pdf) available as PDF.

He also recommends "John Harrison's Contrivance" by Stuart Harrison, which I have also bought off Amazon but
it was a listing with no picture and no description so I'm not sure what's going to turn up.

He also recommends [Harrison Decoded by Rory McEvoy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Harrison-Decoded-Towards-Perfect-Pendulum/dp/0198892675/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1V3IAZHNQN3BL&keywords=harrison+decoded&qid=1699588005&sprefix=harrison+decode%2Caps%2C296&sr=8-1) however
this one is much more expensive so I haven't bought it. Although he does say it is "priceless" so maybe I should.

Hefetrueb used plywood for most of the clock but lignum vitae for "bearings and rotating rollers of lantern pinions".

He uses "beryllium bronze or beryllium copper" for pendulum spring, arbor pivots, and "knife edges of the anchor".
Apparently it is very easy to work (make it red hot and quench it and it gets soft), and also very easy to harden (temper
to 300 deg. C and soak for 3 hours and it becomes "so hard you can cut glass with it"). But highly toxic dust.

The pendulum has a "temperature compensation mechanism" that looks like weights that stick out to either side. The
main pendulum rod is steel, but it has brass rods rising back up to some pivoted weights, and when the brass expands
relative to the steel, it pushes the weights up which countracts the expansion of the pendulum.

Although it seems to me that the expansion of the brass actually pushes the weights *down*, which will make the expansion
of the pendulum even worse. Is this an error in the design or have I misunderstood? He says "...the brass balls are lowered,
and by lowering the centre of gravity of the pendulum, they accelerate the oscillation in fact". Which sounds wrong?
But he says "because I flipped it from the bottom to the top, the effect is also inverted". So he has definitely thought
about it, but I still don't see how it can be right.

He uses an automated winding system with an electric motor switched on/off by reed switches as the weight falls/rises.

An "agate plate with a v-groove" is used as a bearing for the anchor.

The anti-friction wheels have lignum vitae hubs running on beryllium bronze shafts.

The great wheel (?) has a beryllium bronze shaft and runs in lignum vitae bushes.

I think Hefetrueb might not be his real name as it says "Moritz Gretzschel" on the dial.
