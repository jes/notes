## Stepper motor clock

I've printed the hands, here's one with ironing and one without (because I forgot the ironing at first):

Ironing works really well.

I'm satisfied with the lacquer of the frames.

I've screwed the dial blanks to the router table and am engraving the text. I must remember not to use
"break apart" in Inkscape because it makes the toolpath spend all its time plunging and retracting in Z.

I've assembled the geartrains. The bamboo one is good, but the magnetic coupling keeps slipping on the beech one.
(Also I discovered it is definitely *beech* not *birch* because of the many short dark lines in the grain.

I am going to soak the bearings in IPA to see if it frees it up.

I think I'm happy with the hands, so I'm printing the other pair. Then I need to switch back to white and
reprint 2 dial feet because 2 of them have print defects.

Engraving the dials:

First dial spraypainted:

What a mess! I need paint that wipes off more easily I think.

I tried to wipe the paint off quicker on the other one but it is not really any better:

Tempting as it is to just cut them out and call it "artistic", I think the new plan is to spray the
whole thing black more thoroughly and then surface it off until only the text is visible, and then it
will be black on wood instead of black on white. And failing that I'll need to think of something else.
maybe use acrylic paint instead of spraypaint?

I forgot the far one was still wet so now it has water bubbles in it, FML. I thought these clocks
were going uncharacteristically well. I'll wait until tomorrow to surface them off.

Two cables made up, with pin header "plugs" for the motors:

Two clocks with electrics installed:

Great, I got fingerprints in the lacquer on the beech one:

I thought this would be dry by now.

I think I want to make a housing for the motor plug, because it seems a bit fragile, and seems like it might
short against something. Just a 3d-printed cover that I superglue to the pin header would be fine.

It's not glued yet, but maybe adequate, given probably nobody is ever going to open it up. Actually I'll just
put a blob of superglue inside and leave it at that.

## SCAMP

So I need to fix the parser in the shell, also add a test for it while I'm at it.

The issue was that `SingleQuotes()` and `DoubleQuotes()` didn't strip trailing whitespace, so the trailing newline
character resulted in a "parse error (trailing garbage)".

Fixed: https://github.com/jes/scamp-cpu/commit/66c442ecc3d2871b5f1fd70021942bcc7d543156

And it looks like the regex lib basically works. I need some more complex regexes for test cases, but I'll proceed for
now.

Still to do:

 * test capturing groups
 * support non-capturing grouping `(?:...)`
 * support more features (character classes, non-greedy match, '+', more?)
 * currently it anchors at the start of the string but not the end, should make anchoring optional
 * add a case-insensitive option
 * compile to SCAMP machine code
 * stop leaking captures
 * when on laptop, commit the missing `test_basic.sl`
