## Self-aligning Boggle

Overnight I worked out how to make a helical ramp around the pocket that will direct the cube into the bottom.

You just need to sweep a rectangle from the centre of the pocket out to the tip of the "point", up
through a helix.

Here's a single helix that does one lap: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4867

Here's a pair of helixes that each do half a lap, in opposite directions: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4868

Having 2 half-lap helixes has the advantage that the ramp is steeper, but has an unsightly discontinuity
at the top of the ramp.

Could we make it neater by making a datum plane that passes through
the bottom of the point, and the top of the opposite side, and then project a circle onto this plane,
and sweep the rectangle through that circle?

This view shows how the "2 helixes" method results in a ramp that does not lie in a plane: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4869

Here I've put a fillet on the join and it has accomplished most of what I wanted from making the ramp lie in a plane: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4870

So I'm going to print this and see how it works.

So then we could imagine a 4x4 grid of these with the ramps intersecting, and some pyramid like "spikes" in the corners between them.
Then wherever a cube lands, the pyramids push it in to a pocket, and the ramps make the pointy corner spiral into the right orientation,
and the problem is totally solved! What could go wrong?

OK, a better idea than the datum plane to get a planar ramp is to start by making the pocket, cut it with a triangle to make the ramp,
and then build the rest of it around it.

Like this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4871

And then: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4872

Also I realised that I'm setting my sights too low. I'm not trying to make a shape where it's easy to get the cubes into the right
orientation. I'm trying to make a shape where it's *hard to get them to stay in the wrong orientation*.

Frustratingly, the ramp doesn't work very well at all: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4873

I think there is too much space for it to sit above the ramp. Maybe we need to make the bottom of the ramp end a bit
above the bottom of the pocket, so that it falls in once it's reached the bottom of the ramp?

The other issue is that the pointy bit that we want to end up in the corner is actually not the *lowest* part of the cube.
The lowest part is the pointy bit on a different edge. I'm going to cut the bottom out of this demo and see if the cubes reliably
fall through it. If so, raising the ramp up would help.

Yes! It works! Success at last. It falls through with *no* shaking almost every time, and only slight shaking sometimes required.

If the bottom of the ramp is at the halfway point of the cube then it will locate nicely with the pointy bit.

I wonder if the ramp can be narrower.

Here's narrower and shallower and with a drop at the bottom: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4875

OK I actually think the helical ramp works better than the planar ramp. Or maybe it's just the walls around the ramp that
are the problem. Or maybe because the ramp is less steep...

Anyway I think I've had enough of 1x1 prototypes, I want to make something bigger. So then the problem is how do we tesselate these?
Like what goes in between them?

What about this? https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4876

Hmm, I wonder if the ramp won't work very well because it's basically disappeared near the point. I'm tempted to just print it out
and see how well it works.

And assuming this grid works, remaining problems are:

* how to paint the letters
* how to make the letters conform to the surface
* how to make the lid translucent such that you can tell when all the letters are seated, but can't read the letters

This is printing at 75% scale: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4877

Only 10 cubes because that's all that will fit, but I don't need all 16 yet as they don't have letters on anyway, I
just want a bunch of them to test with.
