## Tractor

I have finally worked out why the chain keeps slipping!

I run out of travel on the adjustment before the chain is fully tight. So it has been impossible to properly tension the chain,
even though I'd thought it was working.

So the solution will be to take 1 or 2 links out of the chain and put it back together.

## Car engine

I bolted up the engine mount mock-up:

It fits perfectly, and the holes have no clearance, so I am pretty sure I have the hole spacing correct.

These bolts bottom out in a couple of the holes with 1-2 mm of remaining gap. These are 25mm bolts and this
spacer is 5mm thick, the real one is 35mm thick, so I probably want 50mm bolts. That would give about 15mm engagement
which is nearly 2x diameter so should be good.

## Garage

Need to tidy up a bit. Keep emptying the dehumidifier. I think I have hoovered up all of the mould except on the back of the big
piece of plywood, maybe address that.

Would be good to put up the jes shelf and the rack for holding the blue trays.
