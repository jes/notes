Plan:

* car MOT
* finish the Douzieme gauge
* tidy the garage and office
* maybe start on CAD of the next metal escapement

It's too wet to cut the grass. I've taken the car to the MOT. On to the Douzieme gauge...

Update: the car passed the MOT.

## Making the scale

I followed the instructions I wrote yesterday. Here's after the first pass of engraving (~10 mins):

The writing is maybe too small.

And after sanding the burrs off:

I'm going to run a second pass to make it deeper, and then experiment with trying to put sharpie or
paint in the grooves.

Well I tried to rub some sharpie in and that didn't really work, and then I tried to paint it and rub
the paint off the top and that didn't really work either, but it is readable:

Pretty happy with this, it is made to a higher standard than I normally achieve. Might have been
nice to engrave my name on it, but I'll just leave it now. Time to move on to something else.

Great success, Douzieme gauge completed. Now just some tidying to do, and I can start on CAD of the metal
escapement...

## Metal escapement model

I think I'll do this at 1x scale. So I just need to make up a CAD model with:

* balance wheel
* pallet fork
* escape wheel, on shaft with driven gear, with proper pivots
* barrel, on shaft with driving gear, with a removable pivot to allow winding
* frames

## Next

* make the improved lathe microscope bracket
* on to the metal escapement
