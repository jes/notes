## Woodworking

Second set of shelves now up: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6209

And the workbench is almost finished: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6210

It has the MDF top, flush trimmed all around, and the sides sanded so they're a bit smoother.
Just needs vices.

I have 3 sheets of plywood left over, hopefully I can use up a lot of this on the tractor.
