## Roof

Plan today:

* block off the "rafters" (?)
* put strips up to space the plasterboard away from the aluminium (will I need longer screws?)
* silicone the gutter
* silicone against the wall if it's dry enough
* put insulation up
* post Paul's coin (maybe include a Â£2 pacman if there's time)

I put up the OSB rafter-blocker pieces while Emma and Lucy were at Tiny Talks,
and got most of the insulation done.

Did the rest after they got back:

It didn't take as long as expected, although it was very annoying that the insulation that was sold
as "width: 1200mm" was actually a wide piece and a short piece packaged together. That would obviously
be fine if you were just jamming it in the floor of a loft, but very annoying for trying to hold
it up in a ceiling.
