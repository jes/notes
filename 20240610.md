## Machine building

I've finished drilling out the motor bracket holes, and am gluing the inserts in place using
the brackets as templates:

I cut the inserts in half to work around the cross-threading problem.

Need to take the brackets off at about 1.30pm.

I held up the spindle motor clamp to the Z plate, but it's not obvious where I'll
be able to bolt it on. Probably ignore this for now. I can probably get a decent bolting
point on each side in between the upper and lower carriage, but not sure about the lower one.

I am thinking that I want to put "stops" on the far ends of the ballscrews to stop it
from being possible to drive the nuts off the ends. I think just a cross-drilled hole with
a split pin it that retains a suitably-sized washer.

Next up is probably designing the Z motor bracket.
