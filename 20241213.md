## 3d-printed coefficients of friction study

I have eSun PLA+ (white), Bambu ABS-GF (grey), and Polymaker PC-Max (black) test samples.

Firstly I'm going to record the weight of the empty bucket, and the weight required
in the cup to allow me position the sample so that it doesn't slide, and then
keep adding weight until I am no longer able to position the sample so that it slides.

**Lower sample layer lines in direction of motion, upper sample layer lines perpendicular.**

Empty bucket is **7.58 g**.

 * PLA: 44.33 g, 65.61 g
 * ABS-GF: 40.47 g, 63.79 g
 * PC-Max: 43.58 g, 61.95 g

And the test samples weigh:

 * PLA: 5.18 g
 * ABS-GF: 4.43 g
 * PC-Max: 5.00 g

This gets coefficients of friction:

 * PLA: 0.10 - 0.15
 * ABS-GF: 0.11 - 0.17
 * PC-Max: 0.11 - 0.16

Typing results in here is pointless, I'm moving to a spreadsheet. `data-20241213.ods` in
the NAS CAD friction-testing dir.

One idea would be to put some sort of vibrator on the table so that there is less randomness
in whether or not it breaks friction.

New methodology is to bang the table with my knuckles. If it doesn't slip on the first bang
then that is the small weight. If it doesn't slip after 3 bangs then that is the large
weight.

With more weight in the cup, and with the banging thing, I got:

 * PLA: 0.09 - 0.11
 * ABS-GF: 0.08 - 0.13
 * PC-Max: 0.08 - 0.15

The only thing I can conclude so far is that the material you use doesn't really matter
very much, even if it's ABS-GF, which is surprising because I thought ABS-GF would be
much rougher.

I think we can say:

**To 1 significant figure, the coefficient of friction of PLA, ABS-GF, and PC-Max, as
printed by the Bambu X1 Carbon on default "0.20mm STANDARD" settings", with layer lines
rubbing against layer lines perpendicularly, the coefficient of friction is about 0.1**.

If 0.1 is accurate then I am quite happy about that. That is lower than I expected, good
for the clock.

This paper did some more thorough tests: https://revmaterialeplastice.ro/pdf/19%20CHISIU%201%2021.pdf - they found much higher coefficient of friction than me though.

Still todo:

 * have a quick look at interactions between different materials (not expecting much to change though)
 * layer lines parallel to each other, 45 degrees

## TODO

 * make "rate of change of amplitude" work for historical data
 * make the aluminium frame
 * more gearing stages
 * 3d-printed coefficients of friction study
 * low-friction pivots study
 * make the balance shaft thinner so that the pallets can be smaller, and/or machine a gap for the tooth to pass through closer to centre
 * try with the new bearings
 * try out a hollow balance shaft with tensioned wire and plastic bearings, instead of conical pivots
 * if you add vanes to the balance wheel, does it lose or gain isochrony with respect to pressure?
