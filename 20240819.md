I've added a speed/frequency table for the new CNC machine to jesref: https://incoherency.co.uk/jesref/speed-freq.html

And printed it out to stick next to the VFD.

Plan tomorrow is to drill the table and glue in some threaded inserts.

I think:

 * use CNC to drill the table
 * unbolt table from machine
 * clamp table to aluminium surface
 * transfer hole locations
 * drill mounting holes in aluminium surface (don't go too far over-size, try to be accurate, can always widen them later)
 * epoxy inserts into table

And then I can sort out cable management in the tub. And perhaps think about how to attach the flood coolant nozzle.

And, next time, after the epoxy is cured, I can bolt the table back on, pick up the hole positions, and:

 * bolt the aluminium surface down with only 4 of the 5 bolts at a time
 * machine the counterbore for the head for the bolt that is not installed
 * repeat for each of the 5 bolts
 * drill the grid pattern of holes
 * take the surface off, tap the holes, bolt it back on
