## Keyless entry

New project: keyless entry for the house.
The nissan leaf has keyless entry, where if you have the key in your pocket you can just walk up to the door and press the button on the handle and it locks/unlocks.
I want something like this for my front door, except it detects presence of my phone using bluetooth, or alternatively a "Tile Mate" bluetooth beacon.
And then if you press the button on the door it locks/unlocks the door by rotating the thumbturn on the inside with an electric motor.
No need to get your keys out of your pocket.

Requirements:

 * fail locked, so if the power goes out the doors remain locked
 * existing key still works
 * can still use thumbturn by hand
 * can't be unlocked from the outside just because the phone is inside the house (i.e. make it only detect phones that are substantially outside)
 * easy to completely uninstall to return to dumb-lock state

The thumbturn knob is held on to the lock with a grubscrew, I'm thinking I take the knob off, affix a shaft extension with a new grubscrew, put a gear on the shaft that my motor can turn, and put the knob on the extended end of the shaft.
So then both the knob and the motor can turn the same shaft.
And I'm thinking have some pogo pins in the door jamb to conduct power to the motor.
And have the electronics in a box on the wall near the door, but with shielding so that the bluetooth antenna can only pick things up outside.
I don't mind that the signal will be attenuated by the wall, because I only need very close range detection anyway.
I already have a spare ESP32-c3, which has builtin bluetooth, and I have some quite small electric motors with builtin gearboxes, which I expect will be powerful enough to operate the lock.

So step 1 is make some test module that can stick to the door and operate the thumbturn, then step 2 is to make the ESP32 detect the presence of my phone, and ensure that I can make it only detect it when I'm standing outside, and not when I'm in bed, step 3 is conduct power to the motor through pogo pins in the door jamb, and step 4 is see about using some custom "rolling code" bluetooth app on the android, instead of just detecting the MAC address or something which can easily be replay-attacked.

Also need the button on the outside of the door.

So I think I probably want 4 pogo pins, motor +/-, and 2 contacts that the switch will connect together.
You can't trivially get away with a common ground for the motor and the switch because the motor needs to be reversible, and the method I have for reversing it to swap the positive and negative.
You could obviously reversing it by supplying +5v for one direction and -5v for the other, but that would require a power supply that can give you -5v.

And once it works for the main door I also want "central locking" so that it operates all of the doors at once.
No point having auto-lock on the main door if I have to get the key out to lock the conservatory door right next to it anyway.
And finally, just to increase the attack surface, I want to be able to remotely lock/unlock over the internet.

This is where we're starting.

Obviously if it all works I would put a cover over the works in the final version.
That has 3:1 reduction from motor to thumbturn shaft; there is a tradeoff between making sure the motor has enough mechanical advantage to turn the shaft, without making it annoyingly difficult for a human to backdrive the shaft using the thumbturn.

I have printed these parts, need to make the shaft extension on the lathe before I can find out whether it works.
