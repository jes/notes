## Matter.js

Made a minimal testcase to show my issue with Matter.js and reported on github: https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/issues/1240 https://incoherency.co.uk/matterjs-test-case/

But actually, having made that test case, maybe that is an easier place to construct a model of the pallets, and then
when I get it to work without the erratic movements I can just copy it back to the main simulator project.

I revisited this in the afternoon and did manage to find a solution: https://incoherency.co.uk/matterjs-test-case/fixed.html

I needed to make the two balls be separate bodies and constrain them with constraints, instead of trying to make one compound body.
Seems like it's a bug in compound bodies, but never mind.

## Watchmaking

Last night I was thinking about making the pinions for the watch, and I'm not really sure how I'm going to hold the shafts on the 4th axis, far enough
away from the chuck that my gear cutter can reach them without hitting the chuck. Maybe I need like a "steady-rest" behind it to react the cutting forces,
and then I can have it sticking out a long way without worrying about bending it.

Problems still unsolved on the watch project:

* pivot polishing

* 4th-axis concentricity

* cutting pinions

* making the pivots in the plates

* designing an escapement

* cutting the internal teeth on the barrel

* affixing the mainspring to the barrel

* affixing the hairspring to the plate and balance wheel

## 4th axis

Let's go and look at re-cutting the register on the 4th axis...

Well I think I made an improvement. https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4602

It was clearly cutting slightly out-of-concentric with what was already there, which is good.
I had to cut down the front face because the protrusion ended up too long for the chuck to fit over it.
It feels slightly looser than it did before, but I can't exactly feel play. Maybe there is <0.1mm of play,
but that's better than no play and 0.3mm of error. Will have to see how it goes.

## Lathe microscope

Printed a bracket to mount the binocular microscope on the lathe carriage.

Looks like a great success so far. I may need to remake the bracket in a stiffer material if it proves too wobbly.
Getting the image in focus requires moving the microscope all the way to the limit of its travel, so maybe a taller
bracket would be a good idea too.

Also might be better if it angled towards me a bit, instead of having to stand directly over the lathe.

## Parallel-axis verge and foliot.

Having fixed the pallet model in Matter.js, I fiddled with the escapement simulator a bit.

I discovered this configuration: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4605

It seems to act like a verge and foliot but without the requirement for intersecting axes.
The impulse faces alternately push the pallets one way and then the other. If this idea works reliably
then it would obviate the need for a hairspring (although a hairspring would obviously improve
accuracy).

The main reason not to favour a verge and foliot for my own watch is the size and complexity of
the perpendicular axis, so this could be a real winner.

I don't know if there is any precedent for a parallel-axis verge-and-foliot type escapement, every
example I can find has the verge perpendicular to the foliot.
