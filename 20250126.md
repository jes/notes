## Clock

Around 22k seconds I messed about with some of the bearings, and it seems to have mostly
cured the erratic amplitude thing.

I am also confused why the period sometimes spikes up or down by 100ms or so. I remember
I had tared it reasonably well, but now it is showing the centre position at about -40
degrees. Could be related to that? I doubt the slotted disc is slipping, but maybe the
counter is sometimes getting spurious pulses? Something to keep an eye on.
