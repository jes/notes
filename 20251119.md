This is definitely getting somewhere. I think one more round of filling and sanding and it'll be done. And in fact
I may be better off "filling" with several coats of primer anyway because it really doesn't need a lot and it is
quite hard to apply the bodyfiller neatly.

I'm not going to put a roundover on the sides. It is fine as is and don't want to ruin it.
