## Machine building

First job:

 * go around the important edges with a file smoothing out the "layer lines" and making them perpendicular

This is much more trouble than expected. I've made an improvement, but you could do better.

 * file a dog-bone in the inside corner on the first upright

Easy.

 * set up a square on the CNC router table to do op2 for: table, Z plate, X carriage, they're all small

Okey dokey...

I'm using three plastic bobbins to lay out 3 points to define the coordinate system.

I did op2 for the X carriage first: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5389

But I forgot that the table has been levelled in the centre but not the sides, and the
way this is clamped means the right hand side is lower than the left, so as you can see
the lead screw is not parallel to the part. Need to fix this, re-zero Z, re-cut it,
and see how it looks.

I may need to make the hole extra deep and then put a spacer in there.
