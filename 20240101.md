## Mainsprings

This article explains the modern manufacturing process for mainsprings: https://www.thenakedwatchmaker.com/making-mainsprings

It uses a rolling mill to turn the round wire into flat strips.

And this PDF explains the historical process: https://theindex.nawcc.org/Articles/Blakey-MakingSprings.pdf

It has an awful lot of steps and involves a lot of laborious filing and sanding.

So I think my options are:

 * find a way to make it work with round wire
 * find a completely different way to use a spring to drive a watch (seems very unlikely)
 * find a place to buy flat strips in different widths/thicknesses (seems slightly unlikely)
 * buy ready-made mainsprings (booo)
 * buy a rolling mill (Â£130 on eBay), or make one, and learn how to use it to turn wire into consistent flat strips (seems difficult)

I actually think it could work with round wire as long as the barrel is made well enough. So I'm going to
have a fresh start at trying to make a barrel for 0.7mm wire.

## Thin barrel

A good technique to tell if the barrel is deep enough is to use a straight edge across the walls and see if the wire fits
underneath: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5218

If the wire can be held in place with the straight edge (as pictured) then the barrel is not yet deep enough.

Next up, the hub. I recall that last time the hub didn't end up quite concentric with the shaft, so perhaps
this time I'll try to make the shaft and hub all in one piece. I'll leave the ends of the shaft at 4mm
so that if successful I can potentially turn them down at a later date to suit whatever I want to use this in.

And I didn't like the method of bending a 90 degree hook on the wire to retain it in the hub, because the bend
radius makes it bind against the barrel. Need to think of something better.

Maybe I make the hub very large, and have a complete coil inside the hub, terminated with a larger area with
the wire looped back on itself, like this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5220

Having two loops of the wire makes it at least 1.4mm thick, so I can safely cut the slot with the 1mm end mill.

Empirically, the kind of loop on the end that I can make is 3.5mm long and a little over 1.9mm thick. And I can
easily achieve a 2.5mm bend radius immediately adjacent to the loop:

We can fit this in a 10mm hub, with 4mm reserved for the shaft: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5222

This is what I've got now: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5223

The shaft is a very good fit in the plates, spins nice and freely with almost no play... as long as the screws
aren't fully tight. The screw holes do not line up exactly, very frustrating:

They are extremely close, but because the screws are countersunk, they get pulled to the centre of the hole,
which binds up the shaft. Maybe I should acquire some M1.6 (or smaller!) screws that have flat heads. Or start
making my own screws?

I think the issue might be that when I used the CNC router to drill the screw holes, I didn't get them concentric
with the bore to the required degree of accuracy. I've also been opening up the holes, and countersinking them,
freehand with a cordless drill, which is obviously fine for getting screw holes to line up normally, but not
fine in this application where the screws are pulling the bores out of line.

I'm slowly freeing it up by putting oil on the shaft and running it with a cordless drill, but this is obviously
not as good as making the screw holes line up.

I just noticed there are brass witness marks on the shaft, on opposite sides on each end, which suggests the shaft is
not concentric. It is possible that the new ER32 collet chuck is not very good! Or that it is fine but the concentricity
of a collet chuck is not enough for watchmaking.
