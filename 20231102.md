## Stepper motor clock

I'm going to try to get the cover for the electrics done today. That means making some wooden side supports,
and a clear plastic cover to go over the top.

It's surprisingly hard to take a photo of a clear object, but... https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4925

That is one shoddy-looking part:

* accidentally has holes on the bend lines where they're not wanted
* some of the slots didn't get cut all the way through so are finished by hand
* there are multiple cracks in the plastic
* the bends are not very crisp
* the sides have buckled a bit where it was heated for bending

One of the worst parts I've ever made. It doesn't help that I've got a bad cold, and it
is quite a cold and rainy day, which makes me not want to try very hard.

Maybe the answer is I make a 3d-printed cover for the electrics and put windows
in it made of flat pieces of perspex. Then I don't need to do slots or holes or bends.
Also don't need the wooden side pieces.

I reckon that's a better idea, I'll do that. It would be nice to be able to make bent clear parts though.

So I think I'll just spray some varnish on the wooden parts and then lock up the garage for the day.
