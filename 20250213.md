## Clock

So the next thing here is a larger diameter for the winding shaft, and some flats milled on
to it for keying, and a new winding drum to suit.

I have some thin-wall 12mm bearings, maybe I can find a 12mm shaft.

Not in a useful length. Have ordered some.

In the mean time I can make the bearing holders and winding drum inner piece.

That would suit a 12mm shaft with 2mm taken off it for the flat.

Will also need a new 120-tooth gear.

Ready for 12mm shaft.

## Dots in space

I'll try and look at the gimbal lock problem. I think the problem is that the left/right
rotation is being done around the global "up" axis, instead of the player's local one.

OK, the main issue was that the renderer took a "roll" parameter instead of an "up"
vector. Fixed now.

Next up, let's add bullets.

OK, got some initial bullets. They just shoot straight out and carry on at a constant
velocity until they exit the world.

Occlusion spheres?

There's an occlusion sphere in the middle, with yellow lights all over it, blocking out
the stars behind.

Todo is:

 * gravity?
 * particle effects
 * "physics unification", i.e. don't duplicate all the physics code across every object that moves or collides
 * some sort of basic game

## Countdown

Someone sent me a bug report about the Countdown game, the pause/resume button doesn't
actually work properly! It only pauses the animation, but the clock still runs down in
the background so it jumps ahead when you resume.

Fixed now with Cursor's help, I'm surprised nobody mentioned it before though, it's been
this way for years.
