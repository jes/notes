## Machine building

First task is to put the longer bolts in to hold the machine to the frame. Done, great success. Hopefully it is watertight.

Now I'm going to continue with putting the green circles in the rails. How are you meant to do this? Just hammer them in
with a drift, no better option.

I've ran some GCode on the machine for the first time, worked well.

I'm going to tidy up the garage now, and then start on spindle wiring next time.
