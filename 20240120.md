## G-code sender

I'm wondering if jog mode even needs to be a separate mode. Maybe we just want jog mode to be normal mode?

But we need to make sure that jogging isn't allowed while a job is running. Maybe make it so you can't
exit run mode without stopping the job?

This is latest state:

The "[probe]" text is a placeholder, ideally I'd like to show a little LED indicating the status of the
probe, but it might be too inconvenient to get it out of Grbl. I might just have to put a physical LED on my control
box.

Obvious next steps include:

 * draw a plot of where the tool has travelled
 * show an MDI history
 * make sure we use sync/async grbl mode according to what is typed in the MDI input
 * raw console mode
 * show active key shortcuts
 * support some mouse interaction
 * better "feed hold"/"resume"
 * "stop" - I think this would be feed hold followed by soft-reset? need to check
 * open a g-code file
 * better indication of the state of the auto-connector, while probing for a grbl
 * make the text automatically scale to suit the window?
 * don't attempt jogging while mode is not "idle"?

Plan for tomorrow:

 * tidy up the DRO a bit
 * draw a plot of tool travel
