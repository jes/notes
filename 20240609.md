## Clocks

A few thoughts on clocks:

1. the big year-going clock that I am going to make for the house can have a normal "anniversay clock"-style
pendulum (i.e. a balance wheel doing multiple rotations), and a deadbeat escapement, example here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcVlkql6K7E

2. I learnt in a This Old Tony video that gas struts are constant-force springs! Probably not enough travel to be useful
for my big clock, but it might be cool to make a clock powered by a gas strut.

3. Intersection sundial: make a sundial that has 2 gnomons. Each gnomon is just a vertical rod, except they're leaning over
slightly, and separated from each other. The shadows cast by the gnomons intersect at some point, and that point tells you what
time of day it is (and might also tell you what time of year it is, because the exact point will change based on the year). I'd
have to do some calculations to work out how you'd want to lay it all out.
