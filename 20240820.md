## CNC machine

Plan:

 * use CNC to drill the table
 * unbolt table from machine
 * clamp table to aluminium surface
 * transfer hole locations
 * drill mounting holes in aluminium surface (don't go too far over-size, try to be accurate, can always widen them later)
 * epoxy inserts into table

The corner holes are 15mm in from the edges. So, pick up the front left corner, check
that the back right corner is at (300,200), then drill holes 15mm from each corner?

I'm going to see if I can do drilling with the high-speed spindle, starting with a 3mm drill.
I expect it will work in the Minerva material but might not work so well in aluminium.

Back right seems to be at about (303, 200). Measures about 302mm with tape measure,
so I'll just set it slightly in from the edge.

According to the "lathe speeds" chart, for drilling plastic with a 3mm HSS drill
I want about 2100 to 9200 rpm. Let's go in the middle of the range for now, about 5500 rpm?

Drilled really easily, even feeding in Z at 370mm/min, it didn't show any sign of struggle.

Let's go up to a 6mm drill. Albeit that there is now a 3mm pilot hole so it's not a full
test. This will want about half the rpm, so let's go 3000 rpm for now. Went straight through
at 220 mm/min, I didn't try any faster, it made a bit of a squealing noise when I paused
so I just let it keep going at the same feed rate.

And now let's go 9.5mm? Will want about 2/3 the rpm, so maybe 2000 rpm for this one? And if
it stalls I'll have to go higher. It's actually not trivial to load this drill because
of the constrained vertical height. With a 20mm surface on the table and a workpiece on top
of that, I might not be able to do it.

It went through fine at 2000 rpm and 370 mm/min, this machine is a lot more capable than
I am used to!

It did squeal quite badly once it was all the way through, I think possibly because the
spindle tram is poor?

So that's the first hole drilled to 9.5mm, it is too small for the threaded insert, so I'll
either re-drill it with a 10mm drill, or interpolate the bore until the insert fits, not
sure yet.

I'm going to try to drill the next one with the 9.5mm drill with no pilot hole. Went
all the way through at 220 mm/min, no trouble! Incredible. I'm going to write
some g-code to do the rest of the holes hands-free.

Great success, worked really well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5mlCgdw7yE

So now they need boring out to fit the inserts. I think 6mm single-flute end mill,
and FreeCAD Path Helix?

FreeCAD Path Helix bug:

 * If you set an "Extra Offset", then you can get an error like "<class 'ValueError'>: hole_radius - inner_radius = 4.800000000000001 is < tool diameter of 6.0", but this should be checking the hole radius against the tool *radius*, not the tool *diameter*. It is perfectly fine for a 6mm diameter tool to interpolate a hole of 4.8mm radius!

Workaround for now is to set the tool size to 6.1mm and not set any extra offset.

Interpolating the holes has worked well as well. It took a few passes, and I eventually
set the tool diameter to 5.75mm! Which should have meant it was making holes 10.5mm
in diameter, I guess interpolating the holes means it ends up smaller, I'm surprised it's
by this much though, maybe something to do with the G64 path blending thing? Not sure.

Anyway, I have some good holes now, and the inserts fit in them. So now I need
to unbolt the table and transfer the hole locations to the aluminium surface.

Lol great, I forgot the table surface centre bolt. Will just add this by hand. Also
the centre insert needs to be shorter because of the pocket where the ballnut attaches.

I'm having a bit of trouble drilling the aluminium, it is gumming up my drill bit. It was
sold as 6082T6 but has "714" written on it. Is it 6082T6 or something else? And is it
actually difficult to drill or am I just not very good at it?

714 doesn't seem to be a name for a grade of aluminium. Maybe I just need to put some WD40
on it, I was drilling it dry. It seems like it gets hard near the surface.

Might just be that my 3mm drill is not very effective, or not spinning fast enough. The 6mm
drill (with 3mm pilot hole) goes through much more easily.

All of today's holes drilled: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5550

The holes in the aluminium surface are only 6mm now, can be widened later if necessary.

Now I need to make the short insert, and then epoxy the inserts into the table. The short
insert wants to be 14mm long.
