## Thin barrel

So the plan today is to put a hub in the thin barrel, and if I still have problems then consider
screwing the cap on.

The hub is so thin that the undercut trepans it out. I need to be putting the undercut on the shaft
rather than the face.

Now needs a slot machining in it for the spring to hook into.

Just noticed the bore isn't concentric because I was too lazy to centre-drill it. Must buy a tiny
centre drill.

I'm going to machine the hook using the collet chuck on the CNC router.
