## Isoform

Instead of working through the todo list, I think a good benchmark would be how
efficiently I can recreate some CAD practice parts, in Isoform compared to FreeCAD.

There is https://design-technology-tutor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/autodesk-inventor-practice-part-drawings.pdf

I'm going to have a go at the first one.

I think it can be made out of cylinders and boxes, although that is obviously not
the most natural workflow in the world.

While I'm working I'll notice things that can be improved and improve them.

Actually before I start I am going to work on making it work in millimetre scale,
so the units are millimetres.

I think zoom wants to work by moving the camera in/out instead of by scaling.

OK, I've messed around with zooming and lighting and stuff for long enough now,
it is improved though:

So now, time to try to model the example part.

Starting from a blank document at 10:45.

 * cylinder is 2x as high as it should be
 * property editor is not tall enough for rotation
 * repeatedly adding rotate/translate nodes is annoying, they should be built-in to each node
 * and maybe a way to copy an existing nodes' orientation? and definitely a transform tool
 * "function already has a body" if you try to make a duplicate rotation

The last part seems to lock up the entire program, so that definitely needs fixing.

Oh! It's because they're not actually stringwise identical, because they call
different functions, so it generates each copy separately even though it is uniq'ing
them. Meh, I guess each modifier node needs its own function then. At least we
get to lose the "signature" stuff.

Great, fixed.

10:59, let's have another go at modelling this part.

 * copy and paste
 * type mathematics into input boxes
 * reference properties of other features in input boxes
 * when a subtraction exactly lines up, we see a spurious face at the overlap
 * the tree re-expands every time I change something (maybe tag which nodes are collapsed before rebuilding the tree, and re-collapse them after rebuilding? do you also lose selection?)
 * when you're editing an object it might be worth showing it "on top" of everything
else so you can see what you're doing? could we do a second render pass with only this object, and a different colour, and leave the background invisible?
 * collapse all children
 * expand all children
 * mirror modifier, pattern modifiers
 * set viewing plane
 * create datum line/plane
 * maybe create objects on viewing planes and datum planes?
 * resize document tree view
 * view rotation is still janky

11:12 I have this!

OK it took 13 minutes and in FreeCAD would only take a couple, but I only have like
1 day's work in this entire CAD program.

Just noticed it is not quite right because the chamfers are meant to be 9mm wide
but I made them join up with the web. Never mind. One thing that is really difficult
is accurately positioning things. That's where the Sketcher workbench works really well.
So one big advantage of B-rep is it gives you concrete edges to reference.

And I can fillet it by setting radiuses on things, and on the subtraction.

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6010

But again it would be better if you could explicitly choose which edges to fillet.
For example you might want the outside filleted but the inside of the hole with a sharp
corner.

Let's look at adding rotation/translation as a "generic" property of all nodes.

Here's an example where roughness is applied only to the "hole" feature:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6011

Absolutely incredible, this is the stuff dreams are made of. And I literally have no way
to make something like this in FreeCAD. The best I would be able to do is write a
program to break up a triangle mesh into tiny triangles and then permute the
coordinates of the triangles. But the SDF lets me target the permuting to particular
features of the tree. So good.

So the tree re-expands all collapsed nodes whenever it gets rebuilt, and it gets rebuilt
quite often. One option is to remember the collapsed state and restore it upon rebuild,
another option is to reduce the number of places we need a full rebuild, and edit it
in-place instead? Probably safer to do full rebuilds all the time and just make them
work properly.

Done.

And the next really important thing is showing the object you're currently working on,
so you can see where it is. I like the idea of doing a second rendering pass,
with just that object enabled, drawing the background transparent, the object in
a different colour, and maybe reduced opacity.

But I don't like the idea of having to reset the shader twice per frame. Do I load
a second fragment shader? Do I compile a fragment shader that does 2 rendering passes
on its own? Probably that. So we'd have basically 2 "map" functions, and correspondingly
2 lots of ray marching, normal calculating, etc. And maybe a parameter for turning
off the secondary render when we don't want it?

Sweet, done: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6012

When one of the inputs in the property editor is focused it shows that node in red.

One issue is that if the node has rotates/translates above it, we don't apply those.
So I think when we draw the selected node, combinators turn into no-op but modifiers
still apply? There are actually 2 types of modifier: coordinate transforms (which should
still apply) and "surface treatments" like roughening etc. (which should not).

Maybe we give each node type a flag saying whether it should be applied when doing
secondary render. Great, works.

Now allowing arithmetic input in property editor.

I think I want a X/Y/Z axis direction representation in the corner. And then we can do
view planes.

Wow this is actually super duper hard. It should be easy! I'm just not good enough at
the maths, and Cursor isn't either. I am confused why this isn't trivial. One issue
is that `rotatePoint` rotates the point before evaluating the SDF, which means we
kind of need the opposite rotation now?

Ridiculously, I've made it work by defining an SDF for the axes and raymarching it...

Also, lol, just worked out I have a left-handed coordinate system. Need to fix that.

Also I need to be able to rotate better, currently the X axis is always horizontal
on the screen. And then next up is jumping to orthogonal view planes.

 * jump to view planes
 * fix left-handed coordinate system
 * add "transform" properties to every node, and maybe property editor needs to be more compact
 * some sort of "sticky" secondary node option, so you can look around the 3d scene and it stays up, instead of disappearing as soon as you click
 * mirror, pattern, etc. modifiers
 * when a subtraction exactly lines up, we see a spurious face at the overlap (maybe try jumping into the surface slightly in the ray marching and see if it disappears or actually has an interior? or only say we've hit something if we can actually reach a negative distance? but later on we may want zero-thickness surfaces for sketches mind - but maybe we display those with a very tiny elongation?)
 * collapse all children
 * expand all children
 * viewport rotation is still janky

## Flywheel truck

My 0.2mm nozzle has arrived, so I'm going to print out the gears and shaft spacers
now. Will then switch back to the 0.4mm (or maybe even 0.6mm? haven't used that one yet)
for the wheels, chassis, and flywheel.

Changing the nozzle turns out to be quite a faff. Next time I would get the version
that comes with the thermistor, heater, and fan already attached.

These look great: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6013
