## Bulging blends

It did occur to me that if every surface had a different id then maybe the bulging wouldn't
happen? Because you wouldn't be applying the blend to the coplanar surfaces?

So let's try that out.

Before: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6148

That's 2 10x10x10 cubes, one translated by 5 mm in X and 5mm in Y, and with a 3mm fillet.

So now I need to make `BoxNode` give a different surface id on each side.

OK, I did that. It is annoying to add a blend between these surface ids, because
blends need to take node references even though they only care about ids. I hardcoded
a blend between the ideas I care about.

But `TreeRewriter` is not managing to successfully rewrite the tree to satisfy the
blends. And the reason is that it can only satisfy a blend by rewriting the tree to make
those blend surfaces into sibling children of some combinator. And since it can't split up
a `BoxNode` into multiple surfaces to be Unioned separately, it can't satisfy the blend.

So an alternative is to actually make the Box out of the Intersection of 6 half-spaces.
And if that is good then I can fix the broken distance field that it causes.

OK, I have made it form Boxes out of the Intersections of 6 half-spaces. But it's still
not managing to apply blends to them.

Oh, derp. I made it do Intersections of half-spaces with `structmax` - but the `TreeRewriter`
is operating on the level of `TreeNode`. So I need the BoxNode `makeNormalised()` to
return an `IntersectionNode` with 6 half-spaces as children.

Whoa! Check it out: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6149

That's 2 cubes made out of 6 half-spaces each, with 2 blends applied.

So **yes, this works for preventing blends from bulging**! Finally, something works.

Issues currently are:

 * hover/select on the cube surfaces doesn't work
 * blend ids hardcoded
 * surface ids change every time the scene is recompiled
 * ignores the Box's `radius` parameter
 * Box distance field is now wrong

Also do you reckon the fillet doesn't look like a true circle? May want to address that
at some point.

So I kind of need a way for a `TreeNode` to reserve a bunch of surface ids instead of just
having one. 

This is on the "half-spaces-fiddle" branch. So plan tomorrow is to solve the issues from
above, and then expand this to work with other objects that obviously have multiple surfaces,
like Cylinder and Extrude.
