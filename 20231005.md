## Metal escapement

I want to make the parts in an order that will allow me to check the interaction of the escape wheel
and pallet fork as quickly as possible. So I need:

* frame plates
* standoffs
* escape wheel
* escape wheel shaft (but no pinion needed)
* pallet fork
* pallet fork shaft
* pallet pins

And then I can try to turn it by hand, and work out whether/how to proceed.

## Frame plates

I'm going to do straightforward CAM, with no separate finishing passes,
and see how it looks. If it is bad I can do better, but should be fine as
none of the outside edges are really functional.

The drill holes are at:

* 0,0 (0.5mm)
* 0,7.5 (0.5mm)
* 7,3.57 (0.5mm)
* 4.94,-6.9 (2mm)
