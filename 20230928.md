## Bangle.js commute timer

Worked much better today. The delta time bug is fixed. Next steps on this:

* copy today's commute to `commute.json`
* make it automatically update `commute.json`
* stop the ETA from increasing once the route is "complete"
* show an "elapsed time" above the delta time

## Tomorrow

Stuff to look at tomorrow, before resuming the watch project:

* cut off a piece of plastic for the alley door window
* buy postage for the mirrors
* fit bandsaw blade
* make an ER20 collet tray
* make the Douzieme gauge
* Bangle.js commute timer updates
* Meshmill bug fixes
