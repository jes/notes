## 3d grab handles

I'm imagining a compiled shader that will draw the grab handle at the
position specified in a uniform, and then some code that will detect
when you click on the grab handle, and while you're dragging it will
work out where you've dragged it to, either constrained along a line,
or along a defined plane, or parallel to the viewing plane.

And then while you're dragging it it will continually update the
"property" associated with it.

Is it going to be more efficient to draw it with a shader layer, or
with canvas? Don't really care at this point, shader layer probably
better because then we can have lighting.

So plan is:

 * new JS file, `grabhandle.js` or whatever
 * `TreeNode`s have some way to specify which of their properties need `GrabHandle`s, and which line/plane they're constrained to, if any
 * `ui.js` has some way to instantiate `GrabHandle`s
 * `GrabHandle` can monitor click/drag events on the `glCanvas`
 * `main.js` lets each `GrabHandle` render its `ShaderLayer` to the scene

Do I want to be using proper "deferred rendering" so that depth
information is retained between shader layers? The issue is that the
grab handles will be drawn on top of each other in whatever order
they're drawn, instead of properly occluding based on depth. Don't worry
about it for now, just get one grab handle to work.

OK, I have it drawing a red circle on the scene, and it respects
the coordinate system, and I can drag it left/right along the X axis,
but the dragging doesn't quite work right when I'm not looking
directly at the XY plane.

I actually think `GrabHandle` wants to just yield a scalar quantity
if it is constrained to motion along an axis. You'll initialise it
with an origin, an axis, and a scalar quantity. It starts out at
`origin + axis * scalar`. And whenever it moves it reports back its
new scalar. And you can optionally give it a minimum/maximum value.

Currently I have a test circle that resizes the default box object
in X, but yeah still broken when coordinate system is rotated.

When I rotate the XY plane by 90 degrees, the Y axis is inverted, is
it somehow applying the rotation matrix backwards?

OK I have noticed that the sketch editor also has issues. The coordinate
system inside the sketch editor, while internally-consistent, does not
actually match the coordinate system of the wider object.

The coordinate rotate buttons always rotate around Z instead of
around the viewing axis.

OK, the problem was that `screenToWorld()` and `worldToScreen()` were
using the rotation matrix the wrong way around. That's fixed now, and
the sketch editor is sorted, and now the grab handles no longer need
the Y axis inverting.

The only remaining problem with the grab handle is it doesn't move as far
as your mouse moves. The ratio that it is wrong by seems to depend
on the rotation angle of the scene and not on the zoom level.

Amazing, fixed now!

So now I have 1 `GrabHandle` hardcoded to affect the base box size.

What I want instead is whatever node is selected should have grab handles
for adjusting its properties. For now only scalar properties, we can
maybe do vector grab handles later.

I've made the `TreeNode` class let you specify `grabHandles()` where
you just return a mapping of property names to origin and axis vectors,
and then the `ui.js` deals with turning them into grab handles when the
object is selected.

Works pretty well, but:

 * when you change a property using the drag handle, the change is not reflected in the property editor
 * sometimes the value you're dragging doesn't directly correspond to the shape, for example if you're dragging a "diameter" then it only wants to be positioned at half its value, because it needs to be positioned at the radius
 * sometimes changing one property will change the base location of another property, for example maybe the `roundRadius` handle should be positioned at an edge, but when you change the diameter of the cylinder the edge moves
 * when the object is moved with `Transform` nodes, the grab handles don't correspond to the actual final position
 * it's not always obvious where the "base" position for the grab handle is, we should maybe draw a line from its origin to its active position
 * maybe want to set optional minimum/maximum value (and maybe want this even with the property editor)
 * I don't really like the distinction between a "selected" node and a "secondary" node - I think always show secondary node for selected node, but make it easier to deselect by clicking off everything, and clicking off also closes the property editor?

## Secondary nodes

Also should I make it draw the axis indicator with a separate shader
instead of part of the main one?

Would then be handy to draw an axis indicator showing the coordinate
system of the "secondary node".

Also I kind of do want transforms from the tree to propagate
to the secondary node, so that it is drawn in its actual position
instead of always at the origin.

But maybe instead of the whole "applyToSecondary" thing, we just
have some way for `document` to tell us the net transform that is applied
to the secondary node? Or is "applyToSecondary" the most convenient
way to do that?
