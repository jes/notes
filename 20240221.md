## Composite worktop offcuts

I did the same tapping test as the other day, except this time with M12. The result was the same.

For M8, M10, or M12, drill with the largest drill that is less than or equal to the nominal drill size.
For M12 I used a 10mm drill.

Then first tap with the smallest tap using the cordless.

Then tap with the middle-sized tap.

Then you can screw in a bolt. Tightening it up with the impact driver or a spanner won't strip the thread,
but it will strip relatively easily with the long breaker bar.

So perhaps I want to be getting threaded inserts and epoxying them into the material, instead of tapping it
directly? Or, where possible, bolt through it with a nut on the other side?

## Spindle motor

I've taken apart the 1.5kW spindle motor to see how easy it is to replace the bearings.

There are 2 bearings at the front, with a marking on the outer race to presumably show the intended
direction and order of the 2?

And 1 bearing at the rear, which is marked with the "larger" of those 2 markings.

And all 3 are marked "KH6002-2RZ CTNT/P4 DT CAA S" on the outer race and "1912" on the inner race.

Also marked "OUSRC" on the outer race, 180 deg. away from the "KH6002..." marking.

The other side of the rear bearing is marked "-3" on both the inner and outer races. I haven't checked
if the other 2 are marked differently.

* KH - ???
* 6002 - deep groove ball bearing, 32mm outer diameter, 15mm bore, 9mm thick
* 2RZ - rubber seal on both sides
* C - angular contact, 15 deg.?
* TNT - ???
* P4 - tolerance class per ISO 492
* DT - pair of bearings in a tandem configuration
* CAA - ???
* S - grease filling amount, approx. 30% to 55%

I found this drawing on https://www.cnc4you.co.uk/Spindle/Water-Cooled/Spindle-Motor-Single-phase-to-3-Phase-2.2KW-Water-cooled-ER20-with-Matching-VFD - might have been helpful: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5334

I'm not thrilled by "custom bearings". What bearings should I buy?

So the markings are confusing about whether it is "deep groove" or "angular contact". Apparently they are 2 different
types.

I pulled the seals off one of these, and I think it is not angular contact. The cage is made of some sort of plastic,
maybe PTFE type stuff. And it looks like the surface with "-3" written on it has been ground down, presumably this
creates clearance between the 2 inner races so that they can be tensioned against each other.

I'm tempted to just buy some reasonably high quality bearings of the right size and use a shim washer to space the outer races
apart, so that I can tension the inner races. I think the ones I took off are precisely ground so that when you do it all up fully
tight you have the right amount of preload. Maybe I'll just have to preload it to taste and hope the Loctite holds
it tight?

"SimplyBearings" have "super precision" angular contact spindle bearings in this size, but the cheapest is £60 +VAT,
so it's a no on that.

They also have "budget" 7002 angular contact bearing for £11 +VAT, or lots of options for 6002 deep groove bearings.

So the question is: would I rather have "budget" angular contact bearings, or quality deep groove bearings?
I shall email them and ask.
