## Car ramp toy

A start: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5987

(Only the top one is complete, I'll just mirror it in the slicer to get the others).

Obviously will be screwed to some sort of wooden frame.

I have 5 colours of ABS-GF filament coming.

Now just needs a car that will fit. And probably I should make sure "normal" size toy
cars fit as well.

The road is 25mm wide at the flat part.

Lucy's Mini is 32mm wide, so I'll make it 35mm instead.

I think I want to put washers in the car bodies to give them a bit more weight than just
3d-printed plastic.

And maybe o-rings for tyres? But will they just get pulled off and lost? Maybe don't
need tyres.

And how do you do axles?

I made a toy train once and I just attached the wheels with M3 allen screws, and they
ripped out when the train got trod on, so I probably want the axle to go all the way
through.

The ones she has appear to be mushroomed-over on the ends, not sure I could easily
do that in a way that doesn't buckle the axle or bind up the wheels.
