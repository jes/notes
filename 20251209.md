Last time we drove the tractor the bolt that pins the sprocket carrier to the axle sheared off.

Obviously this is not a very good design. Probably I should weld the sprocket carrier to the axle.

But for now I have just replaced the bolt & added green loctite to take some of the load, unsure how much it will help.

While I was at it I counted the teeth on the small sprocket that drives the axle (i.e. not the one on the motor),
it has 15 teeth, so if I wanted a bit more torque I could make that smaller but then it would snap the bolt more often.

I also noted that the bolt that holds the brake disc carrier had come loose, I added some blue loctite and tightened it up.
