Steering column connection is done: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6266

And axle spacers: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6267

And split pins to hold the wheels on: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6268

I'm not going to bother cutting the axles to length, too much faff, it's fine as-is for now.

So next up is fitting the steering wheel.

I'm thinking the steering wheel can be made out of aluminium plate, with 3d printed parts to bolt to the outside for you
to grab. So imagine like a 3-pronged spikey star made out of aluminium, and the prongs bend upwards, and then the 3d printed
parts bolt to the prongs.

The steering column will be tapped M6 in the centre, and have a deep flat machined on one side, and the aluminium steering
wheel plate will have a matching D-shaped hole in the middle.
