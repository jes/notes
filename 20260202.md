## Car wheels

OK, big idea: flip the wheels around! Duh.

Instead of leaving the "domed" side of the wheel facing outwards, and having long bolts passing all the way through the cavity
with long spacers to bolt things to the wheel...

Just flip the wheel around, have the "domed" side facing *inwards*, and bolt that surface directly to the disc carrier. So much easier.

I had a quick look at this and I think the disc can come at least 10mm closer to the centre of the wheel, because there is more clearance for
the caliper this way, which also allows reducing the scrub radius.

The only downside is that the "ugly" side of the wheel now faces outwards, but I can either ignore that problem, or else make some kind of
hub cap. I think flipping the wheels around solves so many issues that I'd be crazy not to do it.

Compared to the existing 3d-printed disc carrier, this one:

 * can be 10mm closer to the wheel
 * wants "standoffs" 4mm tall to locate in the spot-faced holes
 * wants a 42mm diameter "spigot" to locate in the hub centre

I will obviously need to make the standoffs with the CNC machine, or else use spacers, but that should be easy as they're not very long.

The standoffs at full diameter don't quite fit in my material - but the spot-faces on the domed surface of the wheel
won't contact in those areas anyway so no big deal.

And I will have the issue that I need to somehow control all the spot-faces to the same depth, but that is much easier here because I can see
it from the outside. I can put the disc carrier on and slide feeler gauges around, and then rotate the disc carrier and check again, etc.

The risks are that I might make them all in a flat plane that is not parallel to the plane of the wheel, or that I take too long getting it all
flat and end up removing too much material from every bolt hole. Should be fine though I think.

I may be able to rig up a dial indicator on
something that can rotate in the wheel bearings so that I can test each hole from the axis of the wheel, maybe that would be best.
