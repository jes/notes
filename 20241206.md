## John Harrison's Contrivance

On [2024-11-10](20231110.md) I
purchased Stuart Harrison's
"John Harrison's Contrivance" on
Amazon, but it never arrived. I apparently
forgot about it,
I've just opened a complaint on the Amazon UI.

On 16th of April this year
I emailed Stuart Harrison
to ask if he knew where I could get the book,
and received no reply.

On 28th of November this year I again emailed
Stuart Harrison, just in case he had missed
my first email,
and yesterday he replied to me, with a PDF
of his book! What a result!

He made the mistake of asking about my interest
in Harrison and whether or not I make clocks so I have sent him probably much more text than he wanted to read.

The PDF is broken up into 3 pieces that
combined run to 325 pages. I haven't yet
decided whether I'll print these out myself or
get a print-on-demand service to do it.

## Clock

First thing is re-run the clock now that I've straightened up the balance spring, adjusted
the pivots, etc.

I've re-adjusted the pallets to suit, because the spring attachment got moved around.

Oops, while I was writing my essay to Stuart
Harrison I let it run out of string so
the scale on the charts got ruined!

I have manually zoomed in here to the
relevant sections on the right 2 plots:

So that's within 1.5 milliseconds, which
is better than before but maybe not by
an awful lot.

The relationship between amplitude and period
is basically flat, which is good,
but then I don't know why the period was
dropping over time.

The environmental plot shows: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5873

So temperature was increasing; humidity and pressure decreasing.

Wouldn't we expect heat to make the clock run slower, not faster? Could be unrelated.

## Longer winding drum

I want to make the winding drum longer so that I can make use of longer string on the drive
weight. I think 4x longer, because currently the string only reaches halfway to the floor,
plus I want to add a pulley.

I made it twice as long, and put the coils closer together, and now we have 14.5 turns instead
of 4 turns, so about 3.6x as long.

OK, longer drum is installed, and I've got enough string to fill it. First I'll run it
with no pulley just to confirm the clock still works as before, then I'll try out the pulley.

The torque at the escapement will be slightly less, because I have swapped a short shaft
and a long shaft in order to accommodate the longer winding drum. I can account for this
by moving the remontoire weight further out though. I will try to set it to run at about
255 degrees like it did before.

One issue I've identified is that with the winding drum hanging off the back of the frame,
as the weight runs down it moves further back, which means the weight acts to splay
the frame open more
when it is further down than when it is higher up, which could explain why there is a "trend"
in the amplitude and period over time.

It's just occurred to me that doubling the drive weight, for use with the pulley, will also
splay the frame open more.

So far the longer winding drum is looking like a success.

That's the longest trace yet, and once it settled down it stayed within 1 millisecond.

## Hunting amplitude

I had a dream that the hunting amplitude problem was caused by the ball bearings!

That would explain why it is approximately some ratio of the escape wheel rotation, but
not quite the same as any actual component, and also why the error margin
is so wide: it's not actually geared, it just rolls.

## Encoder UI bugs

1. The reset button doesn't reset all the data.

I think maybe it actually does reset it, but it doesn't actually redraw until there's
new data?

That was it, because plots.js `reset()` clears out `plotStates`, `plotStates` gets recreated
at the next `updateAll()` call, but then looks like there's been no changes so the chart
doesn't get redrawn. Fixed now.

2. The position/velocity plot gets out of sync.

I think this happens when we start dropping the oldest datapoints. Possibly because velocity
can't be calculated until we have N positions, they end up out of sync because we drop
position points before we drop velocity points.

I wonder what to do about that.

3. The timestamps on the environmental data don't match the other data.

This one is because if the clock isn't running for an extended period of time then we
get *multiple* overflows of `micros()`, but we only account for one overflow.

So this problem will go away when the clock is running permanently. But apart from that,
I could work out how many overflows occurred by looking at the wallclock time elapsed since
the last datapoint.

And I'll also want to apply a "rate" to the ESP32 clock to keep it synced with NTP or
whatever, so that would help as well. I was thinking that the rate could be basically
an exponential moving average of the ratio of the ESP32 clock to the Linux clock, and then
we make sure the Linux clock syncs with NTP. We can plot the applied rate in the UI to make
sure we're not doing anything crazy. Applying a rate that smoothly adjusts means we don't
have any step changes in timestamp around the time we re-sync.

But if there's ever more than 60 (30? 10? 1?) seconds between datapoints from the ESP32, then
we can just make a step change re-sync of the ESP32 time to Linux time.

## TODO

 * more gearing stages
 * design the frame
 * store all datalogging persistently, and allow viewing static data from some specified time window
 * put sensors in housings
 * 3d-printed coefficients of friction study
 * low-friction pivots study
 * put the pulley on the falling weight
 * longer string, longer winding drum
 * make the balance shaft thinner so that the pallets can be smaller, and/or machine a gap for the tooth to pass through closer to centre
 * fix encoder ui bugs (see [2024-12-05](20241205.md) )
