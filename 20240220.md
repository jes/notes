## Machine CAD

Still needed:

 * linear bearings on Z axis
 * gantry supports
 * ballscrews + bearings
 * ballnuts + holders
 * shaft couplers
 * motor brackets
 * screw holes

In fact, after Z bearings and gantry supports, I can
potentially do some FEA to work out where it is least
rigid and improve it.

This is the design I want to test first:

I'm having some trouble getting Netgen to turn it into
a mesh:

New plan: save the model as a STL, load the STL back in,
use Part workbench to create shape from mesh with "sewing"
enabled, and then use Netgen on that shape.

Great success!

I'm not sure it's spending the triangle budget in the
wisest way, but I'll take it.

Also, I now have an opinion on what is better out of
putting the plates further apart and sinking the blocks
into the plates. I think sinking the blocks in is better,
because it reduces the size of the leverage on them,
and you don't lose as much strength as it looks like,
because there is still *material* in the area that was cut
away, it's just bolted to a lower thickness. But as long
as the bolted joint is sound, I don't think it
substantially weakens it.

One simplification in the FEA is that the entire machine
is made out of uniform "generic aluminium".

Another simplification is that we assume the linear
bearings are rigidly attached to the rails. In reality
the linear bearings are obviously free to slide, and the
forces are reacted by the ballnut and ballscrew.

I'm modelling the forces by telling it that the
table is fixed in space ("Constraint Fixed") and then
applying a force of 100N to the flat surface at the bottom
of the tool ("Constraint Force"), with the tip of the tool
in the centre of the table and 25mm up in Z.

It is taking a very long time to do the calculations,
but I attached with `strace` and it does look like it's
making progress. It would be nice if it gave some sort
of progress indicator instead of just blocking the UI
thread until done.

Hmm, I don't know what it spent a very long time on,
but it hasn't given me any results. I think I clicked the
"Solver" button in the taskbar, but when I click it now
it doesn't take a long time to compute anything, and tells
me my FEM mesh has no volume elements.

It is writing a bunch of stuff into `./test.out`. From
looking in the source, this is something to do with Netgen.

From https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/freecad-fea.html it sounds like I used Gmsh instead of Netgen before,
but I can't install it right now.

I ran a FreeCAD FEM example, and it worked fine, which
suggests my problem is that the mesh has holes in it. I
wonder if I can patch it up somehow.

The Mesh workbench has a "Fill holes" option, doesn't
fix it though. I tried to "Remesh" in Blender and it
crashed Blender.

I think the core issue is that I have multiple parts with
coincident faces and nothing in the chain from "separate
Part Design parts" to "single FEA mesh" is noticing that these
need to join up.

OK, new plan: model everything again, but this time as a
single Part Design object, obviously simplify the rails
etc., and then try to do FEA on that.

That was a lot less time than I've already wasted on
mucking about with meshes.

And Netgen generated a good mesh first time:

The first result was that almost all of the deflection
occurs in the tool rather than the machine. However
that is probably because I told it the tool is made
out of aluminium. Since I can't easily make different
parts of the model have different materials, I'm going
to lose the tool and pretend all the force is
at the collet nut, now 45mm above the table.

With a 100N load:

* X: **0.02mm** displacement. Uprights flexing.
* Y+: **0.01mm** displacement. Gantry flexing.
* Y-: **0.01mm** displacement. Gantry flexing.
* Z+: **0.01mm** displacement. Gantry and uprights flexing.

I didn't test X+ and X- separately because the machine
is left/right symmetrical. And I didn't test Z- because
you don't generate much force in Z-.

So this was worthwhile: I have discovered that the
machine is most flexible in the X direction, which is
not what I expected.

The easy fix is to add some perpendicular bracing pieces
to the uprights. And probably to the gantry as well,
but that probably wants testing separately.

But first I want to increase the load to 1000N:

* X: **0.17mm**. Uprights.
* Y+: **0.09mm**. Gantry.
* Y-: **0.09mm**. Gantry.
* Z+: **0.08mm**. Gantry and uprights.

OK. I've extended the existing uprights back a bit, and added some buttresses: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5322

I think buttressing like this is going to be more effective, and use less material, than doubling up the thickness.

And now with a 1000N load in X, the displacement is reduced from 0.17mm to **0.10mm**. Not actually
a massive improvement.

It flexes like this (500x exaggerated):

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5323
https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5324

So it looks like most of the movement comes from flex in the base plate. I hadn't even thought of that.
Even if I was going to double up on materials I don't think it would have occurred to me to double
up the base plate. The base plate would be slightly stiffer in practice because it would be bolted to
the steel stand.

Out of interest, if I simply doubled up the uprights, instead of adding buttresses, what would the displacement
look like with a 1000N load along X?

Lol. Max. displacement is now **0.09mm**. So this is in fact slightly *better* than buttressing. It
still twists in the same way, mostly from the base plate flexing.

I'm going to try doubling up the base plate and gantry as well.

Now the max. displacement is **0.05mm** and I think the majority of that comes from bending the spindle motor,
and most of the rest from twisting the uprights.

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5325

Displacements with other loads are:

 * X: **0.05mm**
 * Y+: **0.04mm**
 * Y-: **0.04mm**
 * Z+: **0.03mm**

In Y+ the flex comes mostly from bending the spindle motor, also from bending the bottom of the gantry back, and bending the tops
of the uprights back. And Y- is the same but directions reversed.

In Z+ the spindle motor doesn't appear to bend much (as you'd expect), but otherwise it's the same story: gantry and
uprights bending.

So I say let's proceed with this design: forget the buttress pieces, double up the base plate, uprights, and gantry. The
maximum displacement is reduced by more than 3x in X and more than 2x in Y and Z.

Next up I want to lay out the flat pieces of material that I have, and check that I actually have enough to make all these
parts. My feeling is that I probably do, but need to check.

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5328

D'oh. I don't have enough material! If I use the damaged section of the big piece, then
I can do everything except the second set of uprights, and still have 3 smaller pieces of material left over.
The gantry piece is very close to the exact width of the big piece of material, but the gantry can be made slightly narrower
with no downside, so I'm not worried about that.

Update: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5329

That gets us everything except the second piece of gantry. Since that is just a piece that gets bolted to the back of the
gantry, could I tolerate making it out of 2 halves that are each bolted on separately? I think so. So then I make the
secondary gantry piece in 2 parts, and I can get all of my parts out of the material I have:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5330

Great success.

The square/rectangle parts can be cut out by hand, but I will need to use the CNC router to make some of the
others, which could prove problematic because they are too big to fit on the machine. Could use Ruari's machine?

Also I will probably want to mirror one of the parts with uprights on, because the material has one nice side and one
rough side, and if I want everything symmetrical I will want 2 each way around.

OK, onwards:

 * ballscrews + bearings
 * ballnuts + holders
 * shaft couplers
 * motor brackets
 * screw holes

Regarding ballscrews, I think the ballscrews I currently have are actually too long. Obviously I can cut them shorter,
but can I turn a smooth section on the end to locate in the support bearing, or are they too hard? Can I even hold
them in the lathe without damaging them?

Things I will want to check before actually making any parts:

 * exact dimensions of laundry basket
 * exact dimensions of leadscrews, couplers, bearing blocks, ballnuts, ballnut holders, etc.
 * no interference throughout the full range of motion
 * distance from motor flange to ballscrew bearing, including coupler

I think for designing motor brackets and positioning screw holes I'll want to know those exact dimensions.

So maybe the next useful thing to do is dismantle the milling machine?

I tried scratching a piece of aluminium with a piece of kitchen worktop, and it looks like the worktop is softer
than aluminium. That probably means the machine will perform worse than the FEA suggested.
