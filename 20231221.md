## Pocket watch

Predictably, the watch had stopped when I got to it, but it started again with a bit of a kick. If
I had put the hands on it I might have an idea of how long it ran for.

Measurements:

### Plates

Plate thickness: 0.8mm
Gap between plates: 5.0mm
Total thickness from thickest points: 8.5mm
Outer diameter of movement: 45mm

### Screws

Movement screws: 1.5mm diameter, 2.6mm thread length, 2.5mm head diameter, 0.7mm head thickness
Dial screws: 1.2mm diameter, 2.3mm thread length, 1.8mm head diameter, 0.5mm head thickness

### Mainspring barrel

Outer diameter, incl. teeth: 21.5mm
Height incl. both end caps: 4.0mm
Pivot diameter: 1.7mm
Number of turns for a full wind:  5.5, if 40 hour runtime

### Train

(Possibly wrong nomenclature, I've ordered them starting at the barrel and ending at the escape wheel).

Mainspring barrel to first wheel pinion: 58:8
First wheel to second wheel pinion: 60:8
Second wheel to third wheel pinion: 48:6
Third wheel to escape wheel pinion: 48:6

As a sanity check:

Minute hand is on first wheel, so barrel turns once every `58/8` = 7.25 hours.
Second hand is on third wheel, which turns `(60*48)/(8*6)` = 60 times slower than minute hand.
Escape wheel turns `48/6` = 8 times slower than second hand, which means it completes one turn every 7.5 seconds, or 2 teeth per second.

Mainspring barrel output tooth module: ~0.35
First wheel output tooth module: ~0.30
Second wheel output tooth module:  ~0.30
Third wheel output tooth module: ~0.30

First wheel pivots: 0.9mm
Second wheel pivots: 0.5mm diameter on 1mm shaft
Third wheel pivots: 0.5mm diameter on 1mm shaft

### Balance

Outer diameter: 15mm
Thickness of balance wheel: 0.7mm
Width of balance wheel rim: 1.5mm
Tick rate: 2 Hz cycle, 14400 bph

### Escapement

Escape wheel diameter: 10.0mm
Escape wheel teeth: 15
Distance between pallet pins: 5.0mm
Pallet pin diameter:  0.3mm
Impulse pin diameter: 0.6mm
Slot width: 0.65mm
Distance of impulse pin from balance wheel shaft: 1.4mm
Pivot separation between escape wheel and lever: ~5.9mm
Pivot separation between lever and balance wheel: ~10mm
Pivots: 0.4mm diameter on 1mm shaft.
