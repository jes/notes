## SCAMP bank-switching

I think it would be a good idea to add bank-switching to SCAMP. If nothing else it would
make interactive shell usage about 3x faster (no need to swap out the shell,
and no need to swap it back in at the end).

It would also mean co-operative multi-tasking performance would be acceptable, so we could
add pipes.

I'd probably want to have the kernel in a part of memory that doesn't get bank-switched,
and only the user-space bit gets switched. I don't think it's worth going to the trouble
of splitting the user-space bit up into "pages" and making syscalls to allocate them.
Just get loads of RAM and give each process its own area.
