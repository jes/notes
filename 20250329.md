## Meshes

Current status is my mesh node can draw a mesh, but it is hollow.

So the plan is to have some function tell me the distance from *p* to a
triangle, and whether the ray from *p* to *(inf,0,0)* crosses through
the triangle or not.

Then we pick the smallest distance, and make it negative if we crossed
an odd number of triangles.

So I need to know:

 * distance to triangle
 * ray intersection with triangle

I have it almost working:

Just some spurious points outside the triangle have negative sign.

And some spurious points have incorrect distance.

I am wondering if this is a numerical problem?

Intersecting the tetrahedron with a gyroid, I can see that it is
mostly correct.

Yes, it is numerical error! I increased an epsilon value from 1e-5 to
1e-3 and not it works! 1e-2 also seems to work. I'm not thrilled about
needing magic constants that I don't understand though.

Cursor has given me a longer and more complicated version that works
without a magic constant. I'll keep this for now.

So, good! I can now draw triangle meshes.

I think next up is importing STL files so that I can load meshes from
external tools.

I predict that this will create shaders that are way too slow, and
possibly too long to even be allowed. So then I'll want the voxel
octree system.

OK, I refactored the "Mesher" a bit, to split out STL file export,
Mesh handling, and the act of creating a mesh from an SDF.

And now `MeshNode` takes a `Mesh`, and the STL class can import STL
files as well as export.

I tried to import a 22 megabyte STL file and it failed because of
"too much recursion" in trying to simplify the Peptide tree, lol. So
we don't even get as far as the shader.

The mesh had 34k triangles, so the `min()` chain that finds the closest
triangle in `MeshNode` will go 34k levels deep. We could improve that
by making it "balanced", so instead of `min(a, min(b, min(c, min(d, ...`,
we would do `min(min(min(a,b), min(c,d)), ...`.

So that would fix the deep recursion but may not fundamentally help.
