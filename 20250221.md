## FreeCAD

I think the main things left to do are:

 * fallback synchronous code path for Windows, or if BooleanWorker can't be found etc.
 * try to expose the worker process via the main FreeCAD binary instead of adding a separate one
 * try to make the warning/error messages more suitable
 * and someone who knows the codebase better might be able to advise on how I should tidy it all up?
 * stop doing unnecessary duplicate recalculations (maybe a separate PR for this as it is useful on its own and much easier to integrate)
 * make sure everything that triggeres a Transform recompute can also trigger the Abort dialog (e.g. https://imgur.com/a/2Cua6iR )

But there is now discussion on https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/19710 about
doing it natively with OpenCascade after all, so I may be barking up the wrong tree.

I'll try to make it work via the main FreeCAD binary though.

I think we add some `--boolean-worker` option in `processProgramOptions()` in `Application.cpp`, and then it says `mConfig["RunMode"]` to `BooleanWorker` or something,
which we then implement in `runApplication()`.

Great success, works. You have to go via Python in order to access dynamically-loaded
modules, which is mildly annoying, but the plumbing isn't too bad.

"hyarion" suggests I test out the OpenCascade method of interrupting long-running
tasks.

So there is some "Message_ProgressIndicator::UserBreak()" that you can call to request
that it stop working.

So I think diff my branch from the current main branch, and then just keep the parts
that are to do with the dialog window and throw away the rest. And make the dialog
window call "Message_ProgressIndicator::UserBreak()" when you click the button.

Looks like the only file I want to keep is `src/Mod/PartDesign/Gui/ViewProviderTransformed.cpp`.

Annoyingly, `UserBreak()` is "protected" in `BRepAlgoAPI_BooleanOperation`, so I can't
call it.

Maybe cast to a custom subclass that just makes it public?

Well I got it to compile and run, but it doesn't abort. Just keeps going, as if
the `UserBreak()` doesn't do anything at all.

OK, update is that I need to implement `UserBreak()` and make it return true if the
use has asked to abort. I guess that makes sense.

That didn't work.

But now I see what I need to do: I need to make a subclass of `Message_ProgressScope`
and implement `UserBreak()` in *that*, and then pass the `Message_ProgressScope` into
the `Build()` call.

So, I guess start again from the point where I only have the Abort dialog.

Whoa, I think it might be working. This might also give us the option to actually report
progress percentages!

The big downside is you need it to get to a point where it is ready to be interrupted.
Possibly that is a change that would be easy-ish to upstream to OCCT though: work out
where it is getting stuck and add more `UserBreak()` checks.

"tritao" suggested on Discord trying to do the child process thing but with a child
thread, says you can't abort threads with C++11, links to https://chatgpt.com/share/67b8a487-cb10-8008-a75b-6d77563fff51

One idea is we could use the ProgressIndicator thing as a "primary" method of aborting, but have a "Force abort" if you press Abort and it still hasnt' finished a second later, and then we only do the potentially-dangerous thing if the user really wants it

And tritao adds "and maybe save backup file at that point too".

Skip the backup file thing for now.

So the plan now is to make it kill the worker thread if it doesn't finish within a
second or something.

First result is that it dies with:

    terminate called without an active exception
    Aborted (core dumped)

if I try to abort the thread. Reading the ChatGPT thread more closely, looks like I need
to set a "cancelstate" and "canceltype", let's try that.

Nope.

Next up is wrapping the whole thread in try/catch in case that will do it.

"chennes" in Discord told me this happens if something throws an exception during the
destructor. I pasted a backtrace into Cursor and it told me you need to detach the
thread otherwise when you exit the scope it will `terminate()` because the thread is
theoretically still running but you lost the handle to it?

That's working!

Hmm, it sometimes segfaults FreeCAD anyway.

Another point is that if OCCT is doing multi-threaded work in the background then cancelling the thread that you started won't automatically cancel OCCT's other threads.

Oh, actually, I think the segfault is my fault. I put a `return` where I oughtn't've.
Nope, wasn't that.

I've stashed my changes and trying again, I'm sure on my last commit it wasn't
segfaulting when you abort.

Meh, it's segfaulting every time now.
