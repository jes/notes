The plan is:

 * lose the "Screener" thing
 * make "Mark all seen" send a list of ids in the current view, to avoid the race where it hides things you hadn't seen
 * "bring back later" so if something is important it keeps coming back until you mark it as done
 * make sending email work
 * improve page layout on mobile

OK, screener is gone.

I think the inbox page may end up having tens of thousands of emails in it, may want paginating? Kick that can down the road.

We're now only marking as seen on the emails that you can see.

As for "bring back later", there are a few ways I can imagine wanting to work with this:

1. you mark the emails you care about, hide the rest, and then address the ones you care about one-by-one
2. you care about it but not right now, you want it to come back in an hour, a day, a week, etc.
3. you want it to stay persistently even next time you reload the page, but if it is ignored for a long time it should disappear on its own

So what kind of UI would you want? ChatGPT has some ideas.

You have 3 things to do with an email: Pin, Snooze, or Dismiss.

And you want "Bulk dismiss" to dismiss all that aren't pinned or snoozed.

And you want the Pin to be temporary, so if you want to keep it you have to keep pinning it, otherwise it will drop off.

And you really want to encourage Snooze over Pin, if it's something you want to come back to later.
