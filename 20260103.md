## Old Bear Biplane

I did a bit of sanding on the fuselage pieces: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6374

This is with the belt sander, clamped down to the bench.

Much improved but probably still not adequate.

## Tractor towing hitch

I am starting to think about how to do the towing hitch with minimum hassle.

I could obviously mount an M12 rose joint to the back of the tractor and then put a pin through it on the
trailer and that would be plenty strong and easy to do, but I hesitate only because if I have something sticking out
the back of the tractor then I won't be able to conveniently stand it on end to access the underside.

So, what do?

I think this problem might exist regardless or what method I use.

Maybe I just want some pieces of wood attached either side so that it will stand on those instead of on the rose joint?

That'll do I think.

## Tractor bonnet latch

I have installed this thing off eBay:

It is incredibly cheap and nasty and I have done a bit of a hack job of installing it, but it should keep the bonnet from bouncing around.
