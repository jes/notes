## Busy board

I started making a busy board for Lucy today: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5301

The vertically-arranged doorknobs are sprung differently (top one not at all, middle one springs out,
bottom one springs in). The four holes to the right of that are blind, through, countersunk,
and counter-bored. There are 3x M12 nuts pressed into the board, and an M12 bolt on a string that
can be screwed into the nuts. And there's a steel plate that magnetic stuff can stick to.

I still need to make 3 gears to go at the bottom left, and they'll operate a crank that
slides something back and forth in the horizontal slot.

And I still need to make 8 slidey pieces for the "TTTT" bit at top left, which is
isomorphic to the Amphipods puzzle from https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/23

The board is an offcut of kitchen panelling, it is MDF with some very high-quality
paint on it (possibly it is laminated plastic rather than paint?). It cuts very
well with the CNC router, I used a 6mm 2-flute down-cutting bit at 11000 rpm,
1000 mm/min, 3mm depth of cut, full slotting. Leaves very crisp edges.

## Jog control

Overnight I had some thoughts on this, related to what I committed
in https://github.com/jes/pugsender/commit/7995ffb28076a3a3f2dc39bacb8f845187605e6d

One problem is that if you are continuous jogging X and then you start
continuous jogging Y, your Y movement doesn't actually begin until
the pipeline of pending X movements has drained. And if the jog is
cancelled and restarted, the movement is not at 45 degrees because the X
axis already had built up a distant target but Y hasn't.

So instead of keeping a separate `Target` and `IncrementalTarget`, I should
instead only keep one target, the incremental target, and I should
make continuous jogging use relative movements.

The only reason to use absolute movements at all is so that I can resume
the movement properly after cancelling it (e.g. because another axis
needed its movement cancelling, and Grbl only gives you global cancel).

So I think the `JogCommand()` function would only return the un-met
incremental jog targets, and the ticker function in `jog.go` would send
relative jogs for the axes that are meant to move continuously.

Actually, having written that out, I see now why it wouldn't work. The
incremental jog movements would block the pipeline so that the continuous
jogs don't start happening until the incremental jogs are complete. Drat.

OK, new idea then: whenever a jog is cancelled, if the axis's `Target` is
a continuous target rather than an incremental one, then simply reset
`Target` to `LastPos`, that way all jogged axes will accumulate target
at the same rate, so multi-axis jogging should always be at the correct
angles.

## Communicating Sequential Processes

My Go code in Pugsender is trash at the moment. It has lots of race conditions, the logic is confusing
to follow, and it doesn't work very well.

Apparently the way you should do concurrency in Go is with "Communicating Sequential Processes".

I plan to read https://go.dev/blog/codelab-share and https://go.dev/blog/codelab-share to learn to
do a better job.

But before reading those: I can't yet see how I can use this sort of technique to mediate access
to the serial port. One obvious improvement would be to make a dedicated "writer" goroutine,
which receives lines to write from a channel and writes them to the serial port, instead of every
thread just randomly calling `Command()` and writing to the serial port directly. But beyond that,
I think I still need both the UI thread and the serial reader thread to be able to access the
fields in the `Grbl` struct directly, I don't see how one of them could be passing the reference
to the `Grbl` struct to the other, without blocking anything.

Well I read the first and skimmed the second and I'm still none the wiser. I think obviously make
a dedicated "writer" goroutine, also stop it from leaking the "ticker"-based goroutines in the
even of disconnection/reconnection. Otherwise, maybe separate out the connection stuff from
the machine state stuff, and have it send the machine state over the channel that signals
a status update, so that when the GUI thread is reading the machine state it is reading a different
object?

Also, is there a way to use something like channels for "pub/sub"? If nothing is reading from
the status update channel, I wouldn't want that to block the reader, and also I don't see why
2 things shouldn't be able to read status updates.
