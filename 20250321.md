## Shader layers

I'm going to make a `ShaderLayer` class that has a compiled shader
and a bunch of uniform values. The "renderer" will take a series of
"ShaderLayers" to draw. The "app" will keep one ShaderLayer for the
primary object and one for the secondary object, if any, and pass them
both to the renderer.

And then the renderer is dealing with OpenGL stuff, but the rest of the
application is just dealing with setting uniforms in the ShaderLayer.

Great, working!

And the secondary object is now always shown with genuine reduced opacity,
rather than being drawn solid but blended on top, so we do get to see
the inside of the secondary object now:

## Todo

 * SketchNode is broken for everything (?) except the default triangle
 * Anything that uses `rotateToAxis()` in the shader
 * Interval arithmetic rendering
 * Interval arithmetic marching cubes
