## G-code Sender

I know this is a distraction from the watch project, but I am kind of interested in working on a replacement for
UGS that is less annoying to use. Specifically, I want to be able to drive with keyboard instead of (as well as?) mouse,
and I want to be able to jog the axes precisely and quickly and easily. So it needs to be very easy to switch between
continuous/incremental, and change the size of the increment.

It definitely wants to be keyboard-focused, but it doesn't need to be unnecesarily difficult, so all the space that is
not wasted on buttons can instead be spent on showing you what keys you can press.

But I need to work out how I'm going to implement the GUI. My preferences are Perl, Go, or Javascript/Electron. I don't
want to use Electron because it is slow and annoying, but I can't deny that using HTML is ruddy convenient. I've asked
ChatGPT for some suggestions. Apparently the good choices for Go are [fyne](https://fyne.io/) and [gioui](https://gioui.org/).

There aren't really any good choices for Perl (probably Gtk, but that sounds annoying before I've even looked at it).

First impression of fyne is that it is pretty heavyweight, I'm having to download an awful lot of go modules to get it
to work. And both the ChatGPT example program and the official `fyne_demo` don't appear to work. No terminal output,
no window appears.

So let's look at Gio UI. The example programs on the Gio UI website look more like what I'm going for anyway.

Gio UI doesn't work either:

    $ go run gioui.org/example/hello@latest
    go build gioui.org/app:
    # pkg-config --cflags  -- egl wayland-egl wayland-client wayland-cursor x11 xkbcommon xkbcommon-x11 x11-xcb xcursor xfixes
    Package xkbcommon-x11 was not found in the pkg-config search path.
    Perhaps you should add the directory containing `xkbcommon-x11.pc'
    to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
    No package 'xkbcommon-x11' found
    Package x11-xcb was not found in the pkg-config search path.
    Perhaps you should add the directory containing `x11-xcb.pc'
    to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
    No package 'x11-xcb' found
    pkg-config: exit status 1

Such fun.

In less than the time it is taking to run `apt update` on my desktop, I have got it working on the KDE laptop. (Why is `apt update`
being so slow?)

## Car

I did some long-overdue maintenance on the car today:

 * new fuel filler tube (because of the rust problem with the old one)
 * oil+filter change
 * new spark plugs
 * new piece of windscreen washer hose

The fuel filler tube was Martin's idea, I hadn't considered that it would be an independent part and easy to fit, I kind
of assumed it was welded to either the fuel tank or the bodywork. Easy to do though, just 2 bolts and 2 hose clamps.

Oil and filter change was straightforward, didn't spill too much oil on the drive.

Replacing the spark plugs requires removing the airbox which is bolted to the top of the engine, but of course some
of the bolts were rusted in place, so I sheared a couple of them off. I don't think it's too much of a problem,
might just confuse the airflow sensor if there's a substantial air leak after the sensor. It seems fine though, I don't
think it leaks very much if at all.

And while I was in there I noticed that a short piece of windscreen washer hose had a hole worn in it from rubbing
against something, so I fished out a similar diameter piece of rubber hose and replaced it.

Also got the car washed.

Also I read online that if you disconnect a misbehaving lambda sensor then the car will actually run better. So I have
disconnected the lambda sensor to see if it is any improvement. So far it doesn't appear to be worse, not obvious
where the stuttering problem is gone or not. Apparently having no lambda sensor means it runs slightly rich all the
time, which eventually damages the catalytic converter. I'm also not sure whether it will mean the check engine light
is permanently on, and whether that is an MOT fail. So we may have more work to do come MOT time. (Or a new car to buy).

All seems golden for now though.
