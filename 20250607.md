My piece of half-silvered acrylic arrived, that was quick.

So the idea is you sight along the straight edge of the protractor, lining the 2 sights up with one object, and then angle the mirror until the sights are also lined up with the second object, and then the angle shown on the protractor is half the angle between the two objects (because mirror).

It is an issue if one of the directions is particularly brighter than the other, because then you only see the brighter direction.

I guess for navigating by the stars this wouldn't be a problem.

Also both the handle and the pointer are to the right of the sight line, which means your hands need to contort awkwardly.

And it is too cloudy to survey anything interesting right now, but I think
it works.
