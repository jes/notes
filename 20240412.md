## The watch

Since I've discovered that making a watch movement is too difficult: what if I started with a large-ish working pocket watch movement,
took off the minute hand etc., and rigged it up so that rotating the bezel clockwise winds up the spring and rotating it
anti-clockwise moves the whole mechanism?

That would be an easier place to start.

Taking the pocket watch movement as an example, I would need to probably put an idler against the barrel so that the idler
is the largest-radius part, and then have the idler engage with some teeth on the inside of the bezel so that turning the bezel
winds the watch, and also fit a ratchet somewhere on the mainplate so that it is free to turn inside the case in one direction.

But obviously I'd want to use a movement that works.

## Neural net images

More training on jes-to-Feynman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDTYNs1_DoI

And it's further in the same direction as before: the space between jes and Feynman is basically tending towards just black.
I definitely need to be putting more images in at different `z` coordinates.
