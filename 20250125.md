## Clock

It took about 8 hours to run down, which
is much less than expected. I did observe
the escape wheel skipping teeth a few times,
probably that was happening persistently.

At the same time as altering the escape wheel bearing block so that it holds
one end bearing for the remontoire input shaft, I could integrate the adjacent-shaft
bearings into the same blocks, so that the distances are always set optimally.

I think the theoretical distance between the shaft centres is 51mm, however I've measured
it at 51.25mm.

I am going to make a new balance shaft out of
3mm rod.

It just needs pointy ends turning on it, and
then pallets and spacers to suit.

I'm also modifying the slotted disc so that
the teeth are less tall, for greater
axial tolerance.

I think the 3mm shaft may be too flexible,
not sure.

Seems to be working!

Using the spacer to fit the balance wheel
has not worked very well, it is badly
out of level.

Amplitude is about 250 degrees! Good.

I fully wound it and set it going at 14:37.
