## Mesh import

Two issues here:

1. `MeshNode` has some weird leakage
2. `VoxelNode` clips the bounding box

For some reason the `MeshNode` leakage only appears when evaluating it for `VoxelNode` or
`Mesher`. I think this suggests it only happens at exact 0 coordinates or something.

I wonder if this is because Claude keeps trying to use `P.lt()` and that doesn't exist
so I always rewrite it to `P.lte()` on the basis that exact equality doesn't matter.

Actually it turns out my latest on this is not pushed and I am working on a different computer today.
So, look at something else.

## Automatic differentiation

So the next thing to look at is making Peptide do automatic differentiation.

So each node type will give a function that returns a node that evaluates to its first
derivative.

One important question is how we handle taking the first derivative of a function that yields a vector.
I had kind of imagined that we would just return a vector showing the derivative with respect
to *p_x*, *p_y*, and *p_z*, but Claude is telling me that you should use a Jacobian matrix?

OK, the issue is that the derivative of a *scalar* function is a `vec3`, but the derivative of
a *vector* function is a `mat3`.

This is annoying because it means Peptide will need more robust matrix support. Also you have the
problem that you need to return a different type of derivative depending on whether the variable
you're differentiating with respect to is a vector or a scalar.

Ideas are:

 * only do differentiation with respect to a scalar, do it 3 times (one for each axis)
 * only do it with respect to a vector, since that is all I need it for now
 * support both

I think go for the second.

And how do I take the derivative of a matrix constant? Maybe instead of returning a vec3 Peptide node,
I instead return 3 Peptide expressions? It will obviously (?) be less efficient to evaluate on GPU,
but means I don't need everything to have an extra dimension.

One thing is that the derivative code will probably have a lot of common subtrees with the original code.
Maybe that doesn't matter, because we'll calculate them in different places anyway.

There are some functions that I can't really work out how to differentiate, like `step()` and `mod()`.
For now we're going with first derivative of `step()` is always 0, and first derivative of `mod(a,b)`
is equal to first derivative of `a`. Not sure how legit this is.

I'm having trouble getting tests of second derivative of `vlength()` to pass.

The issue is that the first derivative of `vlength()` involves dividing the vector by its length,
and if its length is 0 then that is no good, so Claude has clamped the length to be above some minimum value.

The issue is the first derivative is not defined for `vec3(0,0,0)`. So does that mean the test is bad? No,
Claude doesn't seem to think so.

I'm going to try out Cursor agent mode to see if it can solve it.

No, it's no better. It seems to be the same as normal Cursor except it automatically searches for
useful context. Maybe I don't find agent mode useful because I already know how to give Cursor the context
it needs?

I could do with a way to dump out Peptide expressions so that I can read them.

It was because it was using `P.max()` to make the length division not divide by zero, and the derivative
of `max()` is discontinuous. Switching to a continuous version has fixed it!

However this kind of issue makes me think that automatic differentiation is actually a really hard problem
and that this isn't going to work for me.

For the expression

    max(vecX(p), vecY(p))

I'm getting first derivative is:

    x = add(mul(step(sub(vecX(p), vecY(p)), 0), vecX(Vec3(1, 0, 0))), mul(sub(1, step(sub(vecX(p), vecY(p)), 0)), vecY(Vec3(1, 0, 0))))
    y = add(mul(step(sub(vecX(p), vecY(p)), 0), vecX(Vec3(0, 1, 0))), mul(sub(1, step(sub(vecX(p), vecY(p)), 0)), vecY(Vec3(0, 1, 0))))
    z = add(mul(step(sub(vecX(p), vecY(p)), 0), vecX(Vec3(0, 0, 1))), mul(sub(1, step(sub(vecX(p), vecY(p)), 0)), vecY(Vec3(0, 0, 1))))

Which simplifies down to:


    x = step(p.x-p.y, 0)
    y = 1 - step(p.x-p.y, 0)
    z = 0

Is that right? I need to get my head around how `step()` is meant to work.

`step(edge, x)` = 1 if x > edge, 0 otherwise.

`0 > a-b` if `b > a`.

So `step(a-b, 0)` == `step(a, b)`.

So I think the `max()` derivative may be using `step()` backwards? Yep, inverting the arguments fixes it.

So, for sake of argument, let's say we have working derivatives now. How do we use them for calculating normals?

It might be good to have a button to toggle between central differences and automatic differentiation, to see
the difference. And forget edge detection for now because it's broken anyway.

Whoa! This is actually working!

I can't tell whether it is faster or slower than using central differences. Automatic differentiation seems to be ever so slightly faster,
but less than 10% better. And they're not pixel-identical, but close enough to be fine. I expect if anything the central
differences version is slightly wrong.

Weirdly, I think the shader compilation time is *worse* with central differences? Even though there is more code in
the automatic differentiation one? Is this because every call site has to have a copy-paste of the code, and central differences
has 6 extra call sites for `map()` but automatic differentiation only has 1 call site for `map2()`?

Yes it does compile faster with automatic differentiation! So that is good.

But there is some glitch if you enable `radius` on a box, the derivative becomes broken. So hopefully I can fix this,
otherwise can revert to central differences.

It's not to do with radius, it's just the existence of a box that breaks it. The normals on a box are broken.

Also: how is this working? I'm returning the first derivative... but that's not the same as a normal! Is this only
working by accident? Is my lighting code all wrong? I think the lighting might only work by accident, my old
central differences method is calculating the *gradient* rather than the normal. Good enough, don't worry about it
for now.

So why is the normal of a box wrong?

I was trying to debug this but getting enormous expressions with lots of constant operations. Obviously the GLSL compiler can do constant folding perfectly well, but it's easy
enough to add to Peptide so I may as well.

Maybe the issue is that because it's a gradient rather than a normal, it's 0 everywhere on the surface of a box, instead of pointing outwards?
No, that's not it. The gradient has 3 values, you'd expect to have 0 in 2 of them and 1 in the 3rd.

Oh, maybe a gradient of a *distance* actually is the same as the normal of a surface.

Claude reckons the issue is that `BoxNode` uses `vabs()` which is
discontinuous at the surface, so doesn't give you good normals. Suggests
changing from `abs(x)` to `sqrt(x^2 + eps)`, which is the same as
`abs(x)` when `x` is much larger than `eps`, but is smooth near 0.

But it doesn't make any difference.

I made the "show coordinates on hover" thing show the computed
surface normal, and it... looks correct? Is it maybe right in JavaScript
but wrong in GLSL?

In GLSL the start of the derivative code is:

    v2 = p;
    v0 = abs(v2);
    v3 = u_Box_4_size;
    f0 = 2.0000000000000000;
    v1 = v3 / f0;
    v4 = v0 - v1;
    v1 = vec3(0.0000000000000000, 0.0000000000000000, 0.0000000000000000);
    v0 = max(v4, v1);
    f0 = length(v0);
    f0 = f0 * f0;
    f1 = 0.0000000000000000;
    f0 = f0 + f1;
    f0 = sqrt(f0);
    v0 = v0 / f0;

And when we get to the line `v0 = v0 / f0`, for points on or inside
the cube we get `vec3(0,0,0) / 0`.

The Peptide code is:

    let d = P.vsub(P.vabs(p), halfSize);
    expr = P.add(P.vlength(P.vmax(d, P.vconst(new Vec3(0.0)))),
                 P.min(P.max(P.vecX(d), P.max(P.vecY(d), P.vecZ(d))), P.zero()));

and `v4` is obviously `d`.

The JavaScript code looks equivalent so should *also* be
doing 0/0. But I made `Vec3.div()` log if the denominator is 0,
and it doesn't log anything.

OK!! Figured it out.

The JavaScript code halts ray-marching when it gets near the surface,
and the GLSL code halts ray-marching when it gets "just below" the
surface (because I wanted to make sure 0-sized surfaces disappear).
If I make the GLSL code stop just *before* the surface then I get good
normals on the box.

So the answer is that my normals are wrong on the inside of the box.

I think I consider that a bug to be honest. The distance field still
has a gradient on the inside of the box, so the first derivative should
still work.

So what is actually going on with that division? What things is it
trying to divide?

Oh! It's the thing where `vlength()` uses `sqrt(x^2 + eps)` as
a smooth `abs()`. `eps` is chosen as `1e-20`, but we
write everything with 16 decimal places in GLSL. So it comes out as
precisely 0. I increased that to `1e-10` and now is working, great
success.

## Tidying up

 * fix unit tests for chmin/chmax/trigonometry
 * fix "leaked" volume on MeshNode
 * add button to toggle back to central differences normals, to help with inevitable debugging
 * try using 2nd/3rd derivatives for edge detection
