## Workbench

The major frame pieces are cut to length and joint faces cut out.

I still need to make some more cuts for the smaller bracing pieces to fit,
then glue and screw it together.

I think the plan is to put a sheet of plywood on the floor, and then assemble
the workbench with reference to the edges of the sheet of plywood, to try
to get it nice and square.

I tried to polish half the silvering off one of my little acrylic mirrors,
but it was time-consuming and I did a bad job. The main impediment is that they
have peel-and-stick backs, and getting the glue off is much more difficult than
getting the silvering off. So by the time you are through the glue, you're
basically through the silvering already, very difficult to do a uniform job.

I gave up and ordered a sheet of half-silvered acrylic off eBay for Â£4.

Why didn't I think of this?

I should make one of these.
