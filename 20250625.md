I've got the track rods (?) made, and threaded, and installed:

To get the steering geometry right, you want the arms at the front to be
pointing maybe 20&deg; forwards, and the arms at the back to be pointing maybe
10&deg; backwards, with the wheels pointing straight.

It takes about 270&deg; of steering wheel motion for the arms at the
back to "reverse" and start pulling the wheels back the other way.

I'm thinking I'll put a stop at the back side of the front axle (lower in pic),
pretty much flush with the back side of the axle.

There is basically *zero* bump-steer. I think there is more play in the system
than there is bump-steer, so you can move it through the whole range of
swinging motion and neither the steering wheel nor the kingpins needs to
rotate.

Still todo on steering is:

 * stops
 * outer bearings at the gearbox end
 * proper input shaft with some sort of key
 * steering tower or whatever; chassis structure to support steering wheel & bonnet
 * steering wheel & shaft

I'm trying to work out a good way to do stops without having to do any welding.
Maybe welding is the easiest way. Also it would be good if they were
adjustable.

For the outer bearings at the gearbox end, I am giong to make some sort
of fitting that will bolt to the plywood and hold the bearing.

I guess 3d-printed is easiest.

They can stick out up to 30 mm from the plane of the side of the chassis.

I'm 3d-printing them.

And in the mean time I can try to rig up some stops.

I did this:

But it doesn't work very well, to get enough steering angle the arm
at the gearbox end is almost pointing straight back, and then it can easily
slip over and go around and around.

So the new plan is to constrain it at the gearbox end instead of at the
front axle.

I ran out of PC-Max midway through printing these, but they're adequate
as is I think. They were meant to look like this:

But they're just installed upside-down instead, with the infill facing the
chassis.

So I think the plan is to stick a bolt through the chassis to catch the arm as
it rotates, to prevent it from spinning all the way around.
