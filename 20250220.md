Someone on reddit said they tried to use it and it said "Failed to execute BooleanWorker"
and then segfaulted.

The first problem is it couldn't find the BooleanWorker binary.

The second problem is the child process segfaults on the call to `exit()`. Maybe
I want `_exit()` instead? That seems to have fixed it.

I've also added a "spinning" progress bar.

Next up is reaping zombie processes. If you abort the operation then the `BooleanWorker`
sticks around as a zombie. Why? I thought I called `waitpid` on every code path.

The exception we get is "Failed to read result size".

Ohhh! It's an exception. `readResult()` throws the exception so we never get to `waitpid`.

I guess the solution is to `try`/`catch` `readResult()`, `waitpid()` in `catch`, and
then rethrow the exception.

Yep, that does the job.
