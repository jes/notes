## Machine building

I've got all 3 motor brackets fitted now, and I was able to carry the machine over to the tub without too much trouble.

Attached all 3 motors, fired up LinuxCNC, worked straight away, great success.

Still need to:

 * seal the tub
 * bolt the machine to the tub
 * take the motors back off and fit the proper "collars" to the ballscrews where they go through the BK12 bearings
 * replace LinuxCNC with grblHal
 * fit the spindle motor clamp
 * get a VFD
