## Clock

I have put the clock together, with the extended bearings and also with fishing line
instead of polyester string.

The fishing line is most inconvenient because it all tangles up if it's not under
tension, but it does seem to be less stretchy than the polyester.

The clock still doesn't quite have enough power to wind the remontoire.

I took the weight tube out and brim-filled it with lead shot. Forgot to weigh it but
my guess is about 1/6 heavier, so maybe 3.5kg now.

Didn't make much difference.

The next idea is to cut the "remontoire weight" down so that less torque is required
to wind it.

This might have done it! It has successfully wound, straight away, twice in a row.

It doesn't seem "powerful" though. But maybe will do for now, I'll leave it and
see what happens. It is 17.03.
