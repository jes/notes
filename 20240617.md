## ChatGPT shell

Following on from yesterday's blog post: https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/chatgpt-linux.html

It would not be too hard to replicate this functionality, but in a way that it works on my own server's
instead of on ChatGPT's sandboxed environment.

 * use the OpenAI "assistants" API
 * give it a function that can execute python code (and maybe others for convenience, like directly execute bash command lines, maybe one that changes the prompt to something useful)
 * every "command line" you type goes to the "assistant", and it can respond with both plain text and with function calls
 * syntax to allow you to directly run shell commands yourself? (prepend with an '!' ? like "!sudo apt update" to run it directly?)
 * a way to let you double-check the output before executing it?
 * a way to abort a command that is about to be executed
 * make it work as a non-interactive "shebang" tool, so you can write "chatgpt shell scripts", and it has a modified system prompt so it won't try to interact, each line is sent as a separate question to ChatGPT and it gets to see the output before doing the next line - maybe we even tell it the whole script upfront so that it knows what it will have to do with the output from each line, before we prompt it with each line individually
 * give it a consistent environment instead of a fresh one each time (e.g. if it assigns to environment variables they should persist, if it changes directory that should persist)

It would be too slow and expensive to use as an everyday shell, but a fun project anyway, and maybe more useful in future.

There is prior art:

 * https://www.gptshell.cc/
 * https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt
 * https://github.com/0xacx/chatGPT-shell-cli

Example of what I have in mind for a "chatgpt shell script":

    #!/bin/gptsh
    list (ls -l) the files in ~/Documents and the backups in ~/backup
    backup any new or modified Documents to a new tar.gz file in ~/backup

And you can imagine that it would note the modification timestamps of all your documents and make a new backup file with only those ones in.
It can do this with either Python or directly with bash, you don't care, as long as it works.

## Machine building

Take the motors off and take the machine back out, and then:

 * seal the tub
 * fit the proper "collars" to the ballscrews where they go through the BK12 bearings
 * fit the spindle motor clamp
 * put the machine back in, with rubber washers around the bolts
 * replace LinuxCNC with grblHal
 * get a VFD

Collars are done. 2 of them were already the right ones anyway, although they were loose. But now all 3
are the right ones and should be tight enough. For the X axis I really tightened the collar up against
the bearings before tightening the grub screw,
for the Y and Z axis I just finger-tightened it and then did up the grub screw. Hopefully Y and Z don't
come back to bite me.

The bolts to hold the machine in the tub need to go through 50mm of baseplate, 25mm of tub, and accommodate
a nut on the bottom. The hole is sized for M8. So let's try to get 4x M8 bolts 90mm or so long,
and 8x (12x?) associated rubber washers.

I put some "Gorilla All-Conditions Sealant" (silicone) in the 4 unwanted holes: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5489

Not a pretty job but hopefully it'll seal. The front ones will be covered by the baseplate so should be fine,
but if the rear ones get disturbed they might start leaking. Contingency plan in that event is to pull the silicone
plug out, and put a bolt through the hole with lots of silicone around it.

So next up is working out how to fit the spindle clamp. Probably about time I ordered a VFD as well. It would be good
if I could put the VFD in the cabinet, not least because I'd be able to easily use the existing ammeter (although
maybe 3 amps is not enough?). Meh, don't worry about it, just get a VFD. If I can't put it in the cabinet I'll just put it at
the side, maybe with its own wall mounting. And if I can't use the 3A ammeter, I can either forget the ammeter or
get a bigger one.

I don't want to have to hook up the VFD to the CNC control, I think I'd rather set the speed by hand. And I
want to be *able* to set the speed by hand anyway, so I really want one with a rotary knob.

Here I've marked up the location of the spindle clamp flange thing, on the Z plate: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5490

The "X" shows the position that I obviously want a bolt. Do I want the second one at the bottom? Which could be too close
to the corner, or do I want it in between the carriage bolts? Which could be too close to the carriage bolts.

I think at the bottom. There are already holes close to the edges, the only thing different here is it's close to *2*
edges. But let's risk it. If it does break I can replace this one part quite easily.

And I only have M4 and M6 threaded inserts, I think I'd really prefer M5 for this because of how close it is
to the edge, but I'll just go with M6. Needs a 10mm hole.

Lol, the bottom holes are very close to the edge: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5491

Oh well, onwards: matching holes in the spindle clamp, and then inserts glued into the Z plate.

Great success:

Bolts line up with the holes and go into the threaded inserts, and there is a bit of wiggle room for alignment.
If there's not enough wiggle room I can drill the holes out larger. So I just need to glue the inserts in and then
I'm done for now.

I've glued them in using the spindle clamp as a template (not that it was probably needed, the holes had very little
wiggle room. Need to demould at 6pm.

Shopping list:

 * M8 bolts
 * rubber washers
 * 2.2kW VFD
 * aquarium pump? hoses? bucket?
 * make the image uploading workflow easier

The longest M8 flanged bolts I could find were 80mm, not sure if that will be quite long enough, will find out.

VFD: I've ordered one of these: https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/ev50-series-vfd-2hp-1-5kw-7-0a-single-phase-220v-variable-frequency-drive-ev50s20015bx0

It is an "EV50" from StepperOnline (although I got it from their eBay shop). There were several different types available on eBay, just a roll of
the dice on which one to buy. I went for this one because the switches on the front panel look higher-quality than the others, but I don't know
if that says anything about what's inside.

Also ordered an aquarium pump, 5m of hose, and a bucket. For the hose I went for 6mm internal diameter PVC hose. Hopefully that is suitable. On
the floor under the machine stand I have 30cm vertical height, so I got a bucket that will fit, it holds 10 litres.

I think I'll need an adapter to fit the hose to the pump, but that should be a quick lathe job,
I'm not worried about that. I already have antifreeze. So I think this is all I need.

Then once it's all assembled in the machine, plan is:

 * measure how square the axes are, make efforts to improve them
 * use the CNC machine to drill holes in the table to put inserts in
 * take the table off and glue inserts in place
 * put the table back on, surface it, make some test cuts?
 * and then maybe make an aluminium table surface so that I don't damage the actual table?
