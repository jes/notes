## 3d-printed coefficients of friction study

I have eSun PLA+ (white), Bambu ABS-GF (grey), and Polymaker PC-Max (black) test samples.

Firstly I'm going to record the weight of the empty bucket, and the weight required
in the cup to allow me position the sample so that it doesn't slide, and then
keep adding weight until I am no longer able to position the sample so that it slides.

**Lower sample layer lines in direction of motion, upper sample layer lines perpendicular.**

Empty bucket is **7.58 g**.

 * PLA: 44.33 g, 65.61 g
 * ABS-GF: 40.47 g, 63.79 g
 * PC-Max: 43.58 g, 61.95 g

And the test samples weigh:

 * PLA: 5.18 g
 * ABS-GF: 4.43 g
 * PC-Max: 5.00 g

This gets coefficients of friction:

 * PLA: 0.10 - 0.15
 * ABS-GF: 0.11 - 0.17
 * PC-Max: 0.11 - 0.16

Typing results in here is pointless, I'm moving to a spreadsheet. `data-20241213.ods` in
the NAS CAD friction-testing dir.

One idea would be to put some sort of vibrator on the table so that there is less randomness
in whether or not it breaks friction.

New methodology is to bang the table with my knuckles. If it doesn't slip on the first bang
then that is the small weight. If it doesn't slip after 3 bangs then that is the large
weight.

With more weight in the cup, and with the banging thing, I got:

 * PLA: 0.09 - 0.11
 * ABS-GF: 0.08 - 0.13
 * PC-Max: 0.08 - 0.15

The only thing I can conclude so far is that the material you use doesn't really matter
very much, even if it's ABS-GF, which is surprising because I thought ABS-GF would be
much rougher.

Still todo:

 * have a quick look at interactions between different materials (not expecting much to change though)
 * perpendicular layer lines

## TODO

 * make "rate of change of amplitude" work for historical data
 * make the aluminium frame
 * more gearing stages
 * 3d-printed coefficients of friction study
 * low-friction pivots study
 * make the balance shaft thinner so that the pallets can be smaller, and/or machine a gap for the tooth to pass through closer to centre
 * try with the new bearings
 * try out a hollow balance shaft with tensioned wire and plastic bearings, instead of conical pivots
 * if you add vanes to the balance wheel, does it lose or gain isochrony with respect to pressure?
