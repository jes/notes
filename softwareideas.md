# Software ideas

## OpenStreetMap viewer

[2023-08-31](20230831.md) has some plans for a tool like the waypoint editor for Waypointer Moto,
but more generally useful. Like a mini-GIS.

## Timegrapher

[2023-09-22](20230922.md) I tried to use tg-timer but couldn't get it to work, and I'm not sure if
it's too specifically targeted at standard lever escapements with defined periods.

I really just want something that will listen to the microphone and tell me what frequency it is
ticking at, and maybe a way to plot some visualisation of the beat/regularity.

## Video hosting

[2023-09-23](20230923.md) has an idea for a tool like imagebin but for hosting videos, that gets
the videos out of the YouTube silo, and gives me convenient tools for counting frames etc. and
embedding in the notes system.

## Image measurer

I do a lot of image measuring, where I load up one or two images in GIMP and measure distances and/or
angles. Examples:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4659

Maybe a little web tool that lets me load in an image (and optionally a 2nd image to alpha-blend on top),
and then lets me measure lengths and angles, and, *importantly*, draws the measurements on top of the
image in a way that makes it convenient for me to show the measurements. For example with red lines
and red numbers like in the examples above.
