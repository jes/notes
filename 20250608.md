## Workbench

Plywood top is now fitted, legs cut down by 50mm as it was a bit tall,
diagonal braces underneath the plywood, horizontal braces on the lower
level, and plywood lower level now fitted.

Next up is MDF on top, then mounting vices, and I think I'm done with it.
Also want to do some sanding of the frame to smooth it down a bit.

## Don't do that

I'm thinking of writing a blog post on the list of reasons we tell children
not to do things.

 * might hurt yourself or others
 * might damage property
 * might lose something
 * might make a mess
 * rude or threatening or otherwise disrespectful
 * noisy or otherwise disturbing or distracting
 * prevent you from eating your meal later
 * prevent you from sleeping later
 * violates social norms (e.g. wearing clothes in public)

More generally:

 * Harm (to yourself or others or animals)
 * Burden on others now (cleaning up a mess, repairing/replacing damaged/lost objects, disturbing someone who is concentrating)
 * Burden on others in future (won't eat meal, won't go to sleep)
 * Violation of social norms (wear clothes, don't point at people, don't say rude or aggressive things)

So these are of 2 kinds:

 * You can't do it, for your own good
 * You can't do it, for someone else's good

And if you assume that others might exact some sort of retribution if you do something bad to them, it all comes down to:

 * You can't do it, for your own good

Although hurting others is still bad even if you are completely sure they
won't retaliate.

## Sundial angles

At the moment the sundial is exposed in the morning by the shadow of the ridge
of the house moving back towards the house. I expect that at some time of year,
it will instead be exposed by the low sun moving around the side of the house.

I took some measurements with the sextant, with the mirror approximately
at the centre of the sundial, and the height read off the sextant and bearing
read off the sundial as a solar time.

As viewed from the sundial, the silhouette of the house is approximately
like this:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6199

 * A: 7.05am 38&deg;
 * B: 7.15am 39&deg;
 * C: 7.30am 39&deg;
 * D: 7.30am 30&deg;
 * E: 7.50am 27&deg;
 * F: 7.35am 34&deg;

What dates will the sun be at those angles at those times? And then
we know that the day before the shadow will be revealed up/down, and the
day after it will be revealed left/right, and hopefully on the exact day the
corner of the shadow will cross the surface of the sundial.

Obviously they are local solar time, so I want to convert to GMT and potentially
BST to work out the actual time of day.

How do you work out the direction to the sun at a particular time?

https://www.sunearthtools.com/dp/tools/pos_sun.php?lang=en I think this tool
does what I want.

Hmm, actually, I have misunderstood something here. The angle of the gnomon
shadow is not the same as the angle of a vertical rod's shadow! So the time
doesn't directly point to the sun direction. And actually I think
the times I wrote down are the angles of the **pm** times.

So let's just convert those to azimuth angles.

 * A: 38&deg; alt., 109&deg; azi.
 * B: 39&deg; alt., 112&deg; azi.
 * C: 39&deg; alt., 116&deg; azi.
 * D: 30&deg; alt., 116&deg; azi.
 * E: 27&deg; alt., 122&deg; azi.
 * F: 34&deg; alt., 117&deg; azi.

And then dates and times (from trial and error on SunEarthTools) are
approximately:

 * A: 9.49am, 29th of July
 * B: 9.59am, 1st of August
 * C: 10.09am, 8th of August
 * D: 9.42am, 31st of August
 * E: 9.58am, 7th of September
 * F: 9.57am, 22nd of August

## Tractor

So I'm thinking of making Lucy a ride-on electric tractor, in the style of a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_TE20

So inspiration pics are:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6200
https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6201
https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6202
https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6203

It doesn't really need to be a replica, just vaguely evoke the idea.

I'm thinking I'll buy an "electric go-kart kit" off the internet, that gets you a 350W motor, speed controller, throttle pedal,
chain, sprockets. And then an ebike battery to go with it. And then the only other tricky part is wheels, you want the wheels
to look about the right proportion for a tractor.

So my plan is to work out what sort of scale it will be, find some roughly appropriate wheels, and then mock it up in FreeCAD
to see if it will look anything like a tractor.

I don't really know how/if I'm going to do the rounded bodywork.

Other inspiration is that "Toylander" do a kid's tractor as a kit: https://www.toylander.com/vehicles/tractor-mfr

It looks like this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6204

So there we see the main structure of it is basically a box that you sit on top of, and there are some foot plates at the bottom. I'm not going to
do fake engine components.

On eBay I have found some wheels that are "18x6.50-8", which means the tyre is 18 inches outer diameter (457mm), 6.5 inches
wide (165mm) and mounted on an 8 inch rim, they look maybe suitable for rear wheels.

From the reference pictures, it looks like the front wheels want to be a bit over half the size of the rears, so we'd want maybe 10 inch
outer diameter.

It looks 10 inch tyres are very common for wheel barrows, sack trucks, etc.

Mocking that up in FreeCAD, does it look like a child-sized tractor?

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6205

Maybe?

Hard to see without a child for scale.

That has a 500mm track (between centres of rear wheels) and 675mm wheelbase (between centres of axles).

Laying that out on the floor with a tape measure, I actually think it is too small.

I measured a chair that she sits on and put this in CAD:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6206

Yeah it seems like the tractor is comedically small even for Lucy as she is now, so not very futureproof. Needs to be bigger than this.

If we look to go about 50% larger, we'd want 27 inch rear wheels and 15 inch front wheels. One issue is that tractor wheels are very large diameter
and narrow compared to most of the wheels I can find, which means I'll probably have to compromise, which it looks like Toylander have also done, their
wheels are too short and too wide.

"22x11.0-8" is available, but that gets us 44% of the way to the ideal diameter, at the cost of 70% extra width. Maybe I just go with the wheels
I already found but scale up the track and wheelbase.

I think this looks a bit more reasonable:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6207

That's with 900mm wheelbase. I think that will be fine. Now maybe mock up the shape of the "box" of the frame? And check that the motor, chain, sprockets
will fit inside.

Looks reasonable I think?

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6208

No idea how I'm going to make the bonnet. The motor etc. fits inside easily, so I've ordered the motor kit, a pair of second-hand
18x6.50-8 wheels that have some annoying-looking keyway fitment, and a pair of brand new 10 inch sack truck wheels with integrated
bearings.

To fit this scale the steering wheel wants to be about 180mm diameter. So potentially 3d-printable.
