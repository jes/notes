## Duplex escapement

Got a balance cock and a bridge in place: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5256

The total height is 11.25mm, but I could lose 1mm off the barrel thickness by making
the barrel surfaces 0.5mm instead of 1mm.

It occurred to me that I can press things onto shafts square by using the lathe! Put the shaft in the chuck
and a pusher in the tailstock, and use the tailstock to push the part onto the shaft.
