## Diaphragm piston air engine with rotary valve

Robert Murray-Smith posted this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOPL0KdLXEc

Also this one about the diaphragm piston: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gvplMQbqnA

I suggested that it would be cool if the valve was in the crankshaft instead of a separate
part, and also that the 2 pipes going to the top of the piston should be reduced to 1 as soon
as possible to avoid wasting efficiency on pressurising the pipe that is not connected to anything.

He nerd-sniped me by asking if I wanted to give designing it a go, so here we are.

The plan is to do as much as I can in one day and then stop.

I don't have any latex gloves and I don't have any dry graphite lubricant, but I do have nitrile gloves
and 3-in-1, so that should do.

We'll use fasteners instead of glue.

The cylinder should bolt down to the base plate, which should have the pipe integrated inside.

The finger should be retained against the cylinder housing by a cylinder bottom-cap (with hole for con rod)
that screws on and seats against a tapered surface, squeezing the finger in between.

We'll put some provision for bolts in the flywheel.

Actually, maybe turn the crankshaft through 90 degrees, so that it goes through the base plate like
it does on the Wig Wag, instead of across the base plate, and then we can easily put the valve
on the crankshaft.

Making the rotary valve seal will be tricky.

One idea is that if we make it have a smaller diameter then there is less sanding to do to clean it up.

We can run a reamer through the female part, and then if the other part can be turned on the lathe then
it shouldn't be too much work.

One issue is that if the valve is on the crankshaft then any misalignment between the axis of the bearings and the
axis of the valve (on either the housing or the crank) will cause it to either bind or leak.

We've got a 40mm stroke.

This is what I've got so far for cylinder and piston: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5686

The piston has a flat surface so that it prints without support. It will use 1mm pins for the pivots.

The cylinder has a hole going through to the base plate at the very top, it has a tapered seating surface
to hold the glove finger, and then a thread to retain the cap that holds the glove on, and a couple of mounting
holes for bolting it down to the base plate.

I don't know if the tapered glove-seating feature is too large to actually stretch the glove over. Might be OK.

I considered putting a flat surface on the wall of the cylinder to match the one on the piston, to
reduce the free space around the piston, but decided to ignore it for now.

The piston is 16mm diameter and the cylinder bore is 19mm, so a 1.5mm gap all around, should be plenty.

I consulted ChatGPT about con rod length, and a longer con rod is preferable because:

 * reduces the angle that it bends to, which makes it push the crank more effectively
 * "more consistent expansion of air"
 * minimising side load on cylinder walls

And the only downside is a longer rod makes for a longer engine.

I've gone for a 60mm con rod, but will see how crazy that looks with a 40mm stroke, maybe it is bad.

I think it'll be fine, if the stroke is 40mm then the maximum horizontal offset of the crank pin is 20mm,
so we have an angle of `arctan(20/60)` = 18 degrees. Maybe the con rod is too long if anything!

Having the crankshaft sit vertically means we can in principle block off the bottom of the base plate and fill
the valve area with oil. Although wouldn't the oil then just get blown into the cylinder and out the exhaust?

The cylinder is printed, I managed to stretch the glove finger over it, it fits pretty well. It felt like there
was not enough space around the finger inside the cylinder, but I blew into the hole and the piston
got thrown across the room. Great success I think.

Actually I think the flywheel and rotary valve can all be made in one piece, at the cost of slightly more
trouble if I want to turn the valve on the lathe. Which I think I'll plan not to have to do. And just need
a small washer to space the crank pin bearing up away from the flywheel surface.

Here it is with con rod, flywheel, valve: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5687

Just needs the base plate, and a nut for seating the glove on the cylinder.

FreeCAD 1.0rc2 keeps turning my transparent parts opaque again. https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/17728

Here's a first pass at the pipe on the inside of the base plate: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5688

I would prefer smoother transitions between the "collector" part and the pipe, but maybe this is fine?

Another way to model it would be to do "subtractive pipe" for 2 short sections of pipe, ending up
tangent to the main pipe. This will do for now.

One crazy idea is to put the crank at the top end of the cylinder, with the valve just going directly
into the cylinder, and then a weird-shaped conrod to connect it to the bottom of the piston. I think
save that for V2.

I'm now procrastinating about where the inlet/exhaust holes are going to come out to the outside.

Lol, I think I made a blunder on the timing. The crank pin wants to be 90 degrees away from where it is.

I'm going to print this base plate: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5689

Will probably need to redo the flywheel due to the timing blunder. Might be able to test it by manually drilling
a new mounting hole though.

I used a short piece of 0.7mm lockwire to make the pin at the small-end. And for a first pass I'm going to use
a cable tie instead of the retaining nut as I still haven't printed that. Just got 20 minutes left to wait for the
base plate to print.

With retaining nut: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5690

I am pretty confident about the valve timing thing, so I'll just fix the model now, and then when the base plate is
done printing I can test it with what I've got and kick off the print for the retaining nut & fixed timing.

It was *almost* as easy as just changing the datum plane, but that then means the hole intersects the seam
and it throws off some of the following geometry, oh well.
