## Clock

I have the new escape wheel and pallets installed. Going to run it with the monitoring,
pallets parallel, one nut, and about the tightest possible depthing.

First go: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5738

Compared to the previous test in same conditions (1 nut, "best" depthing, parallel pallets):

 * period variation is now *much* tighter (range of 7ms vs 30ms)
 * amplitude variation is tighter (~16 deg. vs ~40 deg.)

So, good.

It did look like the escape wheel is closer to the top pallet than the bottom one,
some of the teeth were rubbing the shaft.

Maybe I now actually want some "rest of the clock", so that I can run it for longer?

Maybe I do it first without any kind of remontoire, and then add the remontoire and I
get to see what improvement it makes.

I have run out of 5mm aluminium rod for making shafts, so ordered more of that. Also
ordered more of those little bearings. They are 10mm outer diameter, 5mm inner diameter, 4mm
thickness.

I was considering trying to design the frame part for the new addition so that it would be
able to accommodate the remontoire later, but I think easier just to make a minimal frame
part now and make a new one to suit the remontoire when I am ready for it.

The FreeCAD InvoluteGear "Profile Shift" setting is good, I am setting it to -0.1 to
create clearance between the gears.

We see that the period goes up as the amplitude goes up, so to speed it up in these
cases I think we would want to make the backs of the pallets get *wider* as they move
further out, which is the opposite of what H4 had? We want excess power from the escape wheel
to speed the clock up as amplitude increases, compared to what we have at the moment.

So why is that the opposite of what H4 had? Is it because my pallets have a lot more friction,
so the retarding effect of the frictional rest is stronger than I want? Whereas in H4 the
retarding effect was not strong enough?

Or is it more complicated than that, and the variations in period I'm seeing here are
basically fine, and it's variation with temperature etc. that the shape of the pallets
is really there to contend with?

Once I'm able to run the escapement for longer and get longer data traces out of it I'll
probably have a better idea.

This is what I'm going with for now: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5740

## ABS-GF

My ABS-GF spool has arrived, so to try it out I'm going to use it for the bracket that
holds the new shaft on the clock.

I'm expecting from this material mechanical properties broadly in line with PLA, but better
temperature resistance and a cool surface texture.

I've just noticed the smooth plate says to apply glue stick before printing except for PLA,
which I did not do. Oh well, let's see what happens.

Well it didn't damage the bed, and it prints really nicely:
