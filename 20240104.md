## Duplex escapement

Latest CAD in `duplex-escapement2.FCStd`: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5249

 * escape wheel teeth: **8**
 * unlocking angle: **34 degrees** of roller
 * impulse angle: **46 degrees** of roller
 * unlocking: **11 degrees** of escape wheel
 * impulse drop: **2.5 degrees** of escape wheel
 * impulsing: **28.5 degrees** of escape wheel
 * lock drop: **3 degrees** of escape wheel

And I didn't notice any geometrical issues.

So we're spending `28.5 / 45 = ~63%` of escape wheel motion on
impulse, and the rest on unlocking and dropping. Not clear
whether that is good or bad or indifferent.

I like that the unlocking angle is small (34 degrees vs about 70
degrees in Daniels) without a comparable reduction in impulse
angle.

This version has the roller setup so that it can be made as a
separate component and fitted to a 1mm shaft. But maybe we
could reduce the shaft to 0.5mm where the roller table
needs to fit on, and then we can make the roller smaller to
reduce friction.

I think Daniels said that a typical escape wheel has locking
diameter 12.5x as big as the roller. In my model it is only
about 7x as big.

## Car

The plan is to replace the fuel pump and clean out the tank today.

I went to take the old fuel pump out in good time for the arrival of the new one,
and it was a lot easier than expected, only took me half an hour. 4 bolts to remove the rear seats, and then a few clips and a
big screw cap to take the fuel pump out, piece of piss. I should have done this months ago.

I was expecting to see a layer of rusty deposits at the bottom of the tank, but there were none,
which is probably good. The fuel was ever so slightly cloudy, but not convinced that's a problem.

I expected fuel to squirt out of the fuel hose when I disconnected it, but it didn't, which might be
a clue to the problem, maybe the pump can't hold pressure? Or maybe it is expected to drop pressure if it's
been sitting for a few days.

So I'm not going to bother trying to clean the tank, because I know nothing but fuel
is going to come out. I'm just going to wait for the new pump to arrive, fit it, and see if the problem is rectified.

The new pump has arrived but I am having great difficulty tightening the black plastic screw cap: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5250

It keeps getting cross-threaded.

Also I think the fuel may be contaminated with water, because there is obvious water mixed with fuel
in the pot that I left the old pump in. So the new filler cap should help. Not sure if I will need to
take any other remedial action.

Great success, sorted it, installed, and the car runs and seems healthy. Lubricating the threads with vaseline
was a big help. I couldn't get the screw cap completely tight by hand, so I' m waiting for the tool from Amazon.

The check engine light is still on, I expect I need an OBD2 tool to clear it. I've ordered an OBD2 tool.

The service kit also arrived. I fitted the new air filter, but it's a bit wet and rainy so I don't fancy
doing the oil. And the spark plugs look very inconvenient to access, so unless the OBD2 tool suggests they
might be a problem I'll just leave them.

The screw cap tool arrived, it is shit and doesn't fit very well, but I did get it to work, so it's
nice and tight now, and all done for today. Just needs oil/filter change on a convenient dry day.
