## Plan

 * update the 3d-printed roller escapement model to use the hook tooth form, print it, test it
 * tidy the office
 * book taxis
 * continue working on the thin barrel

## Roller escapement

Looking at the animation again: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5229

I think if the end of the impulse face were hooked back a bit, then we would let the escape wheel move faster
towards the middle of the impulse and slower at the end. That would have the effect of applying more of the impulse
closer to the dead point. And it also has the benefit of slowing down the escape wheel before it lands in frictional rest.

The fact that my 3d-printed model needs a new balance wheel every time I want to change the shape of the roller is
a clue: the roller table should be a separate component so that it can be modified more easily.

I'm going to print these parts: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5231

The shape is a bit different and it now fits 19 teeth on the escape wheel, mainly because the distance between the escape
wheel and the balance shaft has increased.

There's not a lot of clearance between the escape wheel and the balance cock, because the escape
wheel has got bigger: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5232

I'm going to print these parts now and consider what to do about the balance cock while they're printing. Worst case I can
print a new balance cock.

Well it doesn't work very well. https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5233

I realised that the balance cock is optional because the shaft it is running on sticks into the mainplate so far that it holds
itself. Just needs a cable tie to stop the balance wheel falling off the shaft.

It doesn't work very well because it does not provide enough impulse to the balance wheel.

## Duplex escapement

I now see that the duplex escapement is barely any more complicated than the roller escapement, it just requires aligning
the two escape wheels and two rollers. However in my case I can probably make both rollers in one piece, and both escape
wheels in one piece, because I'll be machining them with the CNC router, which means I get to do all the hard alignment work
in CAD. I should probably use a duplex escapement, it is superior to the "roller escapement" because it gives a larger
impulse. It is basically a roller escapement but with an extra (smaller) escape wheel, and an extra (larger) impulse surface.

This video has a good demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kULgoiQ8EXQ

> The duplex escapement was difficult to make but achieved much higher accuracy than the cylinder escapement.

For my purposes I think the duplex escapement is *easier* to make.

And the video also appears to exhibit a *machined* balance spring, very interesting. I did consider the idea of machining
my mainspring, but discarded it as obviously absurd, but maybe it is a good idea? With a 1mm end mill I can make 1mm gaps
between the coils (in the relaxed state), and can in principle make the coils themselves arbitrarily thin. I'd machine
the material to almost-final-thickness on the lathe, then use the router to cut the spring shape to its full depth,
then fill the gaps with some sort of wax or glue that I can remove the later, then use the lathe to cut the bottom off,
exposing the completed spring.

So once I've found out whether this latest roller escapement model is better or worse, I should look at CAD'ing a duplex
escapement where the wheels and the rollers can each be made as single 3-axis parts.

Update: it's worse, so... on to CAD'ing a duplex escapement.

In `duplex-escapement/3dp-model.FCStd`.

There's an article here with some pictures of a historical duplex escapement: https://www.thenakedwatchmaker.com/blog/2021/6/21/a-special-escapement

I'm just going to add a second level to the existing hook-tooth roller escapement model.

Actually I don't think that will work, because there are too many teeth, so not enough space for the impulse pallet
to pass between the adjacent impulse teeth. I'll re-read Daniels' section on the duplex escapement and then think about what
to do.

Important points:

> A small drop occurs between the completion of the small impulse and the commencement of the main impulse. A second
> drop occurs on the completion of the main impulse.

> To prevent the escapement setting, the small impulse must occur equally either side of the centre line with the
> quiescent point of the spring set at the centre line. This will ensuring escaping at amplitudes only slightly
> in excess of the escaping angle.

> The escapement needs the lowest possible ratio between the locking-teeth diameter and the roller.

because a low ratio reduces the unlocking angle, however it also increases the friction.

> Its construction requires most careful and skilled workmansip if it is to work well. The intersection of the roller
> and locking teeth is shallow and tripping will occur if the pivots are slack in the jewel holes. The pressures of the
> action of the escapement are high and all holes should be jewelled to prevent wear to the pivots.

Lol, that's all bad news!

I am having some trouble laying out a duplex escapement in CAD, need to carefully read Daniels again and study the diagrams.
For now I'm going to go back to trying to make the thin mainspring barrel work.
