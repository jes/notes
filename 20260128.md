## Car chassis

I think I'm pretty much satisfied with the front cross-member location, so I can tack that.

The rear cross-member will just go far enough back that it leaves room to mount the leaf spring shackle.

Then I can weld all of the cross-members solid and we have the beginnings of a chassis?

It was going reasonably well:

But the wire kept getting snagged on the spool, wrapped over itself, so at shorter and shorter intervals it would stop feeding and I would have to go and unstick
the wire on the spool.

I eventually got fed up with it and decided to pull all the wire off the spool and make a new spool to wind it on.

But look at the state of this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6465

I'm not going to be able to untangle that! So I'll just order a new spool. Getting "E71T-GS".
