## Jacot Duplex escapement

Found this on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59rCIruI2cc

It has 2 locking teeth, close together, for every impulse tooth. The advantage (for me) being that the escape wheel
turns more slowly and therefore less gearing is required of the train. The disadvantage is obviously that you waste more
energy on frictional rest (but if you can lose a wheel in the train, maybe you get that back anyway?).

But let's try and lay out a normal duplex escapement first.

## Thin barrel

It took me several tries to assemble the thin barrel with the loop of the spring actually catching
in the hook. Eventually I realised that I had cut the end of the wire in the wrong axis so the sharp
point was driving the hook apart and letting the wire slip out. I re-cut the end of the wire perpendicular,
so that the sharp point will catch on the hook, and this worked a bit better, but by this time the hook
was too fatigued from being bent and it broke off:

But also, the slot in the hub was much larger than it needed to be. I could do the same thing again but
make the slot smaller (so that it is stronger) and I bet it would work.

For now I'm just going to try and cut a second slot in the existing hub.

Well I made this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5239

I snapped the old 1mm end mill while trying to probe the coordinate system, and replaced it with a fresh one,
which I expected to work better, but it raised an awful burr.

I recall that the old end mill had 1 cutting edge broken, but maybe that was a blessing in disguise because it turns
it into a single-flute cutter. So:

 * should I be running the 2-flute cutter at only 12000 rpm?
 * should I be feeding the 2-flute cutter at 200 mm/min?
 * should I grind one of the teeth off?
 * should I try to buy 1mm single-flute cutters?
 * should I try to *make* 1mm single-flute cutters?

Being able to make my own cutters would be very handy, although it is faff. For stuff like this (i.e. no plunging) I think a
D-bit might work OK. And that then opens the door to even smaller end mills.
Definitely something to investigate.

I put it together, and the first impression is that it is winding! It is winding really nice and evenly, but does not appear
to be remotely springy.

Here it is fully wound: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5240

It is displaying no tendency at all to rotate the shaft on its own.

I loosened the screws slightly and it looks like it is... almost working? Sort of working? I only get about 3/4 of a turn on it
before it starts to bind up, and if I keep trying to turn it after that point then it won't unwind on its own.

I think the wire is too long, i.e. has too many coils inside the barrel, so there's not enough room to wind it up/down.

## Duplex escapement

OK, I have some thoughts on how to layout the escapement.

If we want an unlocking angle of 60 degrees, then make the slot
in the impulse roller symmetrical, and position it
so that when the roller is rotated to -30 degrees, it is only just
able to accept the locking tooth.

Since it is symmetrical, this means it will allow the locking tooth
to escape at +30 degrees, which gives our 60 degrees unlocking angle.

Now to get 45 degrees impulse angle, we need to make sure that
the impulse pallet is radial to the roller, and
when the roller is at +32 degrees (escaping angle, plus drop to
impulse) then the impulse pallet is
at -22.5 degrees from the
line of centres between the two wheels, and that at this position
the impulse tooth is just touching it, while the locking tooth
has just left the roller.

That means that when it moves around to +22.5 degrees, the impulse
tooth will be just about to stop touching it, and then we've
achieved our design unlocking, drop to impulse, and impulse angle.

Then we need to adjust the number of teeth on the escape wheel
to achieve the desired drop to the next locking. And if this
can't be achieved then something about the proportions needs to
be changed, and try again.

Well I tried the instructions above, and I got this sort of
layout:

Which is obviously not going to work, because on the reverse
swing the impulse pallet will interfere with the impulse tooth.

OK, maybe the circular impulse tooth is suboptimal, but changing
the shape isn't going to solve the problem.

The diagram in "Watchmaking" page 206 definitely has the impulse
pallet radial to the roller, so that's not the problem: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5243

Maybe my issue is that my escape wheel is too small relative to
the roller, so the rotation of the escape wheel for the
unlocking is too large. You can see in the diagram that the
escape wheel hardly moves during the unlocking. Almost all of
the escape wheel rotation is during the impulse. Intuitively that
is what you'd want, because any escape wheel motion not spent
on impulse is wasted.

OK, here's a technique: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5244

Plot a second version of the roller in the sketch for the impulse
tooth, positioned where it would be when the next tooth locks.

Then draw a big circle around it, to match the radius of the
impulse pallet, and if this circle intersects the impulse
tooth then it will interfere on the reverse swing.

Here it is seen that there is basically zero room for the
impulse tooth, so trying to change the impulse tooth isn't
going to work. I need to change something elsewhere. For example
reduce the radius of the impulse pallet.

With impulse pallet radius reduced, there is room for a tiny
impulse tooth: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5245

It can be made more substantial, of course, but we can only put material in the space that is not covered by either of the large circles.

This tooth is only about 0.25mm across, so maybe wants a bit
more room, but I think for the first time, this layout might
actually work!

It would be nice to have wider tolerances, and more teeth on
the escape wheel, but maybe you can't have it all. Maybe this is
why Daniels says "its construction requires most careful
and skilled workmanship".

Here's a version with no internal radii smaller than 0.5mm (i.e.
machinable with a 1mm end mill) and a 1mm bore in both components:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5246

It is unnecessarily complicated, but proves that both parts
can be made with a 1mm end mill in a single 3-axis setup.

The tolerances are remarkably tight. If the locking tooth escapes
too early then the impulse tooth will arrive ahead of the impulse
roller and will interfere with it.

Actually, going back to the pic that shows room for
a tiny impulse tooth: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5245

This actually *does not* show a working tooth, because the
impulse tooth will interfere with the *forward* swing of the
impulse pallet, which we can tell because it overlaps the
large blue circle.

Needs to be more like this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5247

And now at the point of unlocking the impulse tooth has still
not met the pallet, so the pallet definitely has clearance.

The escape tooth can enter the roller when the roller is at
**-27.5 degrees**. The false entry is about **3.25 degrees** of
escape wheel motion. The escape tooth can exit the roller
when the roller is at **+27.5 degrees**.
The escape tooth is free after moving **12.5 degrees**. The
impulse tooth is free after the escape wheel has moved **45.5
degrees**, and the roller has moved to **+82 degrees**. The
next locking tooth lands when the escape wheel ahs moved to
**51.5 degrees**.

So:

 * escape wheel teeth: **7**
 * unlocking angle: **55 degrees**
 * impulse angle: **54.5 degrees**
 * lock drop: **6 degrees**

I can't quite work out the impulse drop because the radii are too
large.

I may have to reduce the 0.1mm external radii.
In particular the initial engagement of the
impulse tooth against the impulse pallet is potentially suspect.

The lock drop is larger than desired. And compared to the
reference designs, the unlocking angle is small and the impulse
angle is large. That sounds good though: a small unlocking angle
means it will run with less amplitude, and a large impulse angle
means it will deliver more impulse, albeit asymmetrically.

However what I have here won't actually work because the locking
tooth enters the roller too deeply: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5248

Darn. I feel close though. I would want to:

 * fix it so that the locking tooth can actually fit in the slot
 * reduce the 0.1mm radii on the end of the impulse tooth and
 * impulse pallet
 * try to increase the number of teeth

I think the latest I have in `duplex-escapement2.FCStd` has no geometrical
issues. The unlocking angle is only about 36 degrees, but Daniels
writes about "the inherent disadvantage of the relatively large escaping angle",
so I think it is advantageous if the unlocking angle is small.
