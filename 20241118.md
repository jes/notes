## Light gates

I need some sort of feature inside the housing to stop
the PCB from tilting, and then just a straightforward
bottom cover. And the bottom cover needs protrusions to
constrain the actual light gates.

Stick up by **5 mm** to constrain the light gates.

Stick up by **1 mm** to hold the PCB.

And the PCB pocket is 18.5mm deep, less 1mm for the
clampy part, less 3.4mm for the PCB thickness, so
the protrusion to hold the PCB on the other
side needs to be **14.1 mm**.

Pretty pleased with this.

## Encoder UI

I want this to have a "tare" button or something to
mark the current count as the centre position.

I want units in seconds and degrees instead of the
"count" and milliseconds or whatever it has at the
moment.

And I want a second plot that shows the balance
velocity, and maybe even a third that shows the
acceleration.

I have this now: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5726

But I'm seeing a lot of "buffer overflow detected" in the terminal, which means the
Arduino code probably does need the buffering thing that I thought I could get away without.

Also the web ui is very laggy. I think it redraws the chart after every data point, I
should make the server buffer data points for 100ms or so and send them in batches.

Also if the serial device gets out of sync by even 1 byte (e.g. because the device
was plugged in but nothing was reading from it and the kernel buffer filled up), then
we never recover.

I've added the buffering back to the sender.

I added some smoothing to velocity and acceleration and it looks like this:

I think it might just be an issue with not having enough precision in the data, because we
can only measure down to 2 degrees.

With the balance swinging freely (no escapement) we have:

So the period is ever so slightly lower at high amplitudes. Is this because the spring is
hitting the shaft? Or that's just life? And at low amplitudes the data precision is not
enough to get a consistent value.

I'm printing some new shaft collars for the escape wheel shaft because they've been slipping and allowing it to run away. This time in PAHT-CF for stiffness. The PLA ones seemed fine at first
but maybe they crept over time. Will be interesting to see if PAHT-CF also creeps.

With a bit more timestamp precision:

So that's very interesting! There looks like a linear relationship between ampltiude
and period at high amplitudes, and then when the amplitude drops too low it switches
into a different regime? The even/odd periods separating is just due to precision
on the encoder I *think*, but if you average 2 consecutive readings then it still
looks like it changes around 90 degrees. This has to be to do with the spring hitting
something, right?

Maybe don't worry about it for now, but keep an eye on it in future.

## Clock

And here's a trace of it actually running:

Is that good? Don't know yet! I expected to see a more obvious periodic signal, from
variations in the escape wheel as it goes around to different teeth.

If the period is 2.1 seconds and it has 55 teeth, then it should repeat every
115.5 seconds? I'm going to shift it over in gimp by about 115.5 seconds and see if
it looks more obvious.

Maybe! The parts that show up darker are approximately the same but offset by about 115.5
seconds. So there does look to be a periodic signal, but it is much more random than
I expected.

That's running with just one M20 nut for a drive weight. Next I'll try with two.

It doesn't work with two, the escape wheel is too wobbly, so it either binds up
on the pallets or skips teeth. I think I need to square it up again by tactically wedging
paper in it. It has got bent either because I took it off the shaft and put it back on,
or because I whacked it with my chair.

I've noticed that some of the escape wheel teeth have their tips missing. That's almost
certainly from when I've whacked it with my chair. Darn. I'll just have to print another
escape wheel.

Here it is with 1 nut after straightening out the escape wheel:

The amplitude is higher than before, possibly because with the escape wheel straighter
I can get tighter depthing.

Now trying with 2 nuts. I think this is not working well, it keeps skipping teeth.

Should I reduce the number of teeth so that I can make them stronger?

Part of the teeth-skipping problem is that the depthing is not deep enough, so the angle
that the escape wheel tooth rests on the resting surface is trying to deflect the escape
wheel away.

So I think yes consider reducing the number of teeth on the escape wheel, but also increase
the depthing. I don't really want to make the resting surface any larger, because that increases
the distance travelled during frictional rest. I'd rather make it smaller if anything.

So the plan is:

 * make the tooth tips stronger
 * increase the depthing without increasing the resting diameter
 * reduce number of teeth as necessary

And an idea to keep in the back pocket is that we could machine away part of
the balance shaft to allow the escape wheel teeth to pass closer to its centre.
