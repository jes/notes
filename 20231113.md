## Odd jobs

Tidied the office.

Fixed the constant paper jamming problem in the printer by
following this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA54lzHAdss

Fixed the laptop (the issue was the "0" key
would keep repeating once pressed) by tipping some isopropyl
alcohol into the switch and hammering the key a few times. Great
success. Time to install NixOS on this puppy.

Fitted the pipe in the alley with just one screw.
I think this will be adequate, but can always fill the join
with silicone if it proves not to be.

I am having trouble getting the laptop to boot the NixOS
installer, annoying. I don't know what is wrong, no error
messages, just doesn't boot. I'm going to try putting
the PopOS installer on the same USB stick and see if that boots.
Hmm, I can't even see the USB stick in `dmesg`.

I think it might be a bad USB stick, I'll try and find another.
Great success, NixOS installer boot menu loaded up on first try.

I can't fix the chopping board, too difficult to get the edges
square. I've chucked it in the wood pile, maybe can use it for
some CNC parts.

## NixOS

So I'm finally trying out NixOS. First impression is that
"tap to click" doesn't work on the Touchpad. Hasn't this problem
been solved years ago in sensible distros? Apparently I need
to set some `configuration.nix` setting to add a kernel
parameter.

The other issue is that, OK, "the system is declarative"
because you specify everything in `configuration.nix`... but
what about the things you *don't* specify in `configuration.nix`?

Like I changed Gnome to dark mode using the "Settings" window,
but this obviously doesn't do anything to `configuration.nix`.
Same for setting up Ublock Origin and DuckDuckGo in Firefox.

It's the classic problem with supposed "declarative" systems
like Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Docker. They work fine as long as you
stay on the happy path, but they fall down as soon as you deviate.

Also I'm used to being able to drag a window up to the top in
Gnome and it automatically maximising, but this doesn't seem to
work, maybe that's a PopOS-specific thing.

## Escapement

I'm 3d-printing the plastic escapement model from yesterday.
The white filament has all cracked where it goes into the
printer, annoying. Why is white filament so brittle?

Also the printer seems to be under-extruding slightly. I've
increased the flow rate from 95% to 99%, but not sure why it
has changed from before.

If it turns out that the balance wheel isn't heavy enough, I can
probably redesign it to have some holes around the perimeter that
nuts or bolts or ball bearings can get pushed into.

Shafts/pins needed:

 * 2x pallet pin: 1.5mm diameter, 10mm long
 * impulse pin: 1.5mm diameter, 18mm long
 * 2x shaft: 2mm diameter, with 1mm diameter pivots, <38mm between pivots, ~3mm pivot length
 * barrel shaft: 2mm diameter, >44mm long, no reduced diameters
 * balance shaft: 2mm diameter, with 1mm diameter pivots, <19mm between pivots, ~3mm pivot length

Also need to bring in drill bits to open up 1mm and
2mm pivot holes.

Well I was making the shafts and it was all going well, and using
the 4th axis to cut pivots, and then I was trying
to jog the machine around to zero the X axis ready to cut
another pivot, and the left/right arrow keys
stopped working, and then all of a sudden the left arrow key
acted like it was stuck down, and it drove the tool against the
work piece and snapped the tool off. Very frustrating.

Is this a Bluetooth problem? Or just the key not working
very well? Need to watch out for this happening again.

Was thinking I could really do with a CNC lathe for parts like
this, instead of pissing about with the 4th axis.

OK, great success, I've made all the shafts and pins, just
waiting on the 3d printing.

I measured the under-sized pivot that I made the other day by
accident, and it was about 0.20mm, and felt reasonably robust,
so maybe I could go quite a bit smaller than 0.5mm for the watch
pivots if necessary.

Let's look at fitting some of these pins/shafts into the parts
that I have already printed.

Well I built it up, using the old mainspring as
a balance spring:

It runs, but needs quite a lot of weight and keeps stopping,
I think I need to clean out the pivot holes and maybe oil them.
Or maybe look at the gear teeth. Not sure where the problem
is exactly.

The back plate is too flexible, and the pallet fork is too
flimsy.

The spring is obviously not centered on the shaft, that could
do with tweaking.

But it looks like it works pretty well so far. By far the
highest amplitude of any escapement model I've yet built.

## Stepper motor clock

The capacitor has arrived, it is even bigger than I expected:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4977

Time to try it out...

Whoa! Actually a great success!

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4978

It is running backwards though, but I could just swap the
coils over or something to solve that.

It has so much torque that when I try to stop it with my finger
it tips the whole clock over, and also it has broken the ratchet
by forcing it around backwards.

Yes! Great success.

Where am I going to mount this???

For now I'm going to take the ratchet off, and swap the coils
over to hopefully make it run the other way.

No, not swap the coils, just swap orange for pink.

Good, that worked. Now if I switch to the 6v coil does it still
work?

Yes! Seems good, and still really hard to stall. So I don't need
the 9v transformer after all. And in fact I could probably get
away with even less than 6v. Need to see how hot it gets, but
this is probably acceptable.

I could consider trying to source a physically-smaller 100uF
capacitor, or maybe try to make a feature of this one.

## Tomorrow

 * sort out the spring on the escapement model
 * sort out whatever is making it bind up (pivots? gears?)
 * record it running with different weights, measure amplitude and frequency
 * experiment with making small parts with a 0.25mm nozzle
 * see how hot the clock is getting, put it back together if all is well
