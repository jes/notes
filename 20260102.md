### Sliding seat

Seat is now able to slide back and forth in these rails, and then you drop the bolt through the hole to hold it in place.

Seems good. May want spring-loading on the bolt to prevent it from vibrating out of place. And may want a nice handle on top of the bolt
to make it easier to pull out. But fine for now.

### Throttle conditioner

I removed the throttle conditioner to see if it was indeed the cause of the lack of power, and it was! Much faster now.

I really would prefer gentler acceleration from a standstill, but not as much as I like having enough power to drive uphill.

So we're leaving it without the throttle conditioner now.

### Bonnet stay

A piece of wire prevents the bonnet from flopping on to the floor when opened.

### Next

I think the next thing is the rear mudguards and then paint?

I will possibly need to buy materials for making the mudguards, annoyingly. I think I want some aluminium angle section
to make the outer frame of it, and probably need to buy some thin plywood for making the panels. I'm just going to do one
flat horizontal panel over the top of the wheel, and one diagonal panel going down from the top one to the foot plate.

And I'm indifferent as to whether the mudguard slides with the seat or not. Whichever is easiest.
