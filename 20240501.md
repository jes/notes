## Deadbeat escapement simulator

So the plan now is to lay out the escapement according to the description in "The Modern Clock".

First I want to add support for the obvious input fields, and then I'll add more fields as they become
apparent.

Well this is what I have now: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5429

Todo:

 * the "Pending changes, click apply" thing from Oscillating Engine Simulator
 * output plots
 * status output: amplitude, period
 * read the book and make the geometry correct

## Formpacker

Would be good to have some "auto-configure" option which will take a reference to a form (or find
the only form on the page? or all input elements?) and automatically setup the field spec.
