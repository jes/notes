## Tractor

I'm expecting the motor to arrive today, would be good to spin it up
and see that it works.

The motor listing says that its "rated speed" is 2750 rpm. I don't know if
that is the speed it tops out at or not, will have to see when it arrives. But
let's assume that's how fast it will spin at top speed.

The rear wheel diameter is about 430 mm.

I want the tractor to go maybe 6 mph, which is 9.65 km/hr, or
9650 m/hr, 160 m/min.

So in 2750 revolutions of the motor we want to travel 160 metres.
160 metres is 372 revolutions of the wheels. So we need to gear the
motor down by 2750/372 = **7.4x**.

That may be a bit much to do with just one stage of sprockets. The motor
comes with an 11-tooth drive sprocket, so I'd need a ~81 tooth rear sprocket.
The sprockets it comes with are described as "25H".

An 80-tooth 25H sprocket is available on eBay, so maybe that isn't outrageous.
It has 160mm diameter, so fits well within the size of the wheel. So maybe I
just buy an 80-tooth 25H sprocket? It's only £7, can't go wrong.

I think try to measure the chain that arrives to check that it actually is
25H, and spin up the motor to check that it actually does spin at 2750 rpm,
and if both are so, then buy the £7 sprocket.

And then for the rear axle I think I want some 19mm diameter steel that is
800 mm long, and matching bearings.

And for the front axle I want some 16mm diameter steel, which I'll maybe
bend (?) or else somehow fabricate into stub axles and kingpins. Kick that can
down the road I think. Maybe an M16 bolt would be better.

The closest Rapid Metals had to 19mm round bar is 19.1mm, I guess that is
slightly over 3/4 of an inch, which is 19.05mm. Oh well, probably close enough.
I just need to be able to jam it through the wheels I have.

And, great, of course nobody makes bearing blocks to take a 19mm bar. Maybe
I would be better off getting a 20mm bar and turning the ends down to 19mm? I'll
do that. And I'm getting "UCF204" bearing blocks for the rear axle.
