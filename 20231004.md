## Lathe microscope bracket

I said:

> the carriage microscope is slightly too close to the work, the position where it's in focus is just beyond the end of its travel. Also it doesn't have enough travel left/right or forward/back, so I should make a new mount for it that rectifies these problems. Also the mount is a bit floppy, and it would be better if the eyepieces ended up at 45 degrees instead of vertical.

So it needs:

* spacing upwards
* longer slots in all directions
* more rigid if possible (PC Blend?)
* 45 degree tilt

The 45-degree tilt is the hardest part, because I don't know where the actual focal axis is.

What I can do is drive it to the end of its travel, position something at the focal point,
and then measure this position relative to some reference on the bracket, then I can put
a datum line there in CAD, and then I know I need to rotate the mounting surface
around that line.

It's about **45.5 mm** above the surface of the bracket that clamps down to the carriage,
and about **7.5 mm** back from the front of it.

Oh, that's when it's at the end of travel. I should measure the length of travel and
position a *second* datum line at the bottom. The travel is about 40mm.

So actually I think it will work if the flat bit that the microscope bolts to
is level with the rotation axis. So that should be easy enough.

Sighting across that surface, I can see the datum line: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4753

Now want to tilt the surface, but maintain that property.

Well, it's not exactly pretty...

But maybe it'll do the job?

Actually, I'll just add a bit more rigidity...

Lovely job. Let's print it in PC Blend and see how we go. Actually just PLA for now. If I like it but want it stronger,
then PC Blend. Maybe rather than PC Blend I should instead find a way to integrate some metal rods to make it stiffer.
I think stiffness will be more important than strength.

## Metal escapement

Let's go with 1x scale, but module 0.4 on the gears, and 0.5mm for the small pivots.

Scale drawing of the pallet fork: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4760

And a layout of the whole mechanism: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4761

This is mostly the same as the model on the desk, except with a 7-tooth pinion instead
of 8-tooth, and corresponding reduction on the barrel gear from 40 teeth to 35 teeth.

The barrel gear has a 2mm bore, for a 2mm rod to go through, with the idea that the 2mm rod can be removed
to wind the string.

I didn't make the pallet fork in the "English lever" shape, but I will want to move to that eventually because it
allows the escape wheel and balance wheel to get closer together.

I will probably also want to experiment with making the lever longer, because that allows for a larger balance wheel.

Oh, this also lacks provision for a hairspring, and it could be thinner if the escape wheel were moved to the other
side of its pinion.

Hmm, if I bend the lever too far, then the escape wheel *can't* go the other side of its pinion else it will interefere
with the balance wheel. So the question is do I want to make it as thin as possible, in which case I move the
escape wheel past its pinion and limit how far
around I bend the lever so that they don't interfere, or do I want to make it with the lowest overall diameter, in which case I leave
the escape wheel where it is and bend the lever as far as I possibly can?

I think let's go for smallest overall diameter.

Here it is with the lever bent by 20 degrees: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4762

I'd like to try putting the "lever" arm inline with the discharging pallet arm, just seems
elegant that way. Let's have a look at that. It's at **29.2941 degrees** from horizontal (blue dimension):

Hmmm, it definitely *could* work, but in the configuration I have here it interferes with the escape
wheel pinion:

But I do like the simplicity of only having 2 arms on the "pallet fork", and it is much more compact
than the first layout above, despite being totally equivalent. So maybe I just need to make that pinion
a bit shorter.

Here's a folded-up layout, with a "skeletonised" frame:

The tabs on the sides of the frame are to help hold it in the vice. This is designed to have
M3 bolts running through it, but at some point we could switch to using M1.6, or smaller, threaded into
the standoff at each end?

Includes a "collet" as described in [2023-09-21](20230921.md):

I don't know how the hairspring is going to be attached to the frame. Will improvise that when I
get to it. Maybe cable tie it to the standoff??

This is in `metal-escapement2.FCStd`.

Materials required:

* 0.5mm brass for pallet fork, escape wheel, barrel gear (part this off a rod as per "Making gears" in [watchmaking.md](watchmaking.md)?).
* 1mm steel rod for balance wheel shaft, pallet fork shaft (use the blue pivot steel, if the lathe can cut it)
* 2mm steel rod for removable barrel shaft
* 6mm steel rod for barrel
* 2.5mm brass for balance wheel (part this off a rod?)
* 6mm brass rod for standoffs
* 1mm aluminium/brass for frame plates
* 3mm aluminium rod for collet
* 4mm (?) steel rod for escape wheel shaft with pinion

The width at the root of the escape wheel pinion is only just under 0.5mm - possibly could make this with the tapered ball-end mill
instead of making a special gear cutter?
