## Escapement

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvf0xXi8Ryg

Increasing the drive torque by 2x increased the tick rate by 32%, which is much more in line with
what I was seeing in the simulation, but much worse than what I saw with the old 3d-printed
prototype. Maybe the configuration of the springs in the old prototype was actually very effective?

I think I want to get a stronger hairspring and try again.

I made a replacement hairspring out of a piece of copper wire:

Yes, works much better. Now increasing drive torque by 2x only increases tick rate by 10%.

It looks like the geometry of the thing is not as important as the tuning of the weights and
springs.

So what's next on the escapement? Probably transition to metal, and go smaller?

The escape wheel here is about 75 mm across. In the mock-up of the watch I have it at
13 mm across, which is about 1/6 of the size.

The root of the tooth on the escape wheel is about 5 mm long, so I could reach in there
with a 1 mm endmill at 1/5 of this size, which is almost all the way there.

Why not go 1/3 of this size? And then that's halfway to watch scale, and we have, as a guide:

Frame thickness: **2 mm**

Frame size: **33 mm * 38 mm**

Balance wheel thickness: **3.3 mm**

Balance wheel diameter: **27.3 mm**

Escape wheel thickness: **1.6 mm**

Escape wheel diameter: **25 mm**

Barrel wheel thickness: **1.6 mm**

Barrel wheel diameter: **35 mm**

Pallet pin diameter: **1 mm**

Although we can alter the barrel wheel to suit the module 0.4 cutter, maybe?

So the frame would be 2x 2 mm plates of probably aluminium, with 2 pillars holding them apart.

We'd need some finer thread to use for the drive weight. We need a method of attaching a hairspring.

List of parts to make:

* 2x frames
* 2x pillars
* balance wheel
* balance wheel arbor
* escape wheel
* escape wheel arbor, with pinion
* barrel wheel
* barrel wheel arbor
* 2x pallet pin
* method of attaching hairspring to balance wheel
* method of attaching hairspring to frame

Does cutting brass with a 1 mm endmill on the router actually work? Feeds and speeds calculator says,
for full slotting with a 1 mm 1-flute cutter:

* 24000 rpm
* 130 mm/min
* 0.25 mm depth

So this sounds possible.

So plan for this evening is to CAD an escapement model that can be made in metal, at about 1/3 of the scale of
the 3d printed one I made today.
