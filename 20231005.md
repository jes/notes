## Metal escapement

I want to make the parts in an order that will allow me to check the interaction of the escape wheel
and pallet fork as quickly as possible. So I need:

* frame plates
* standoffs
* escape wheel
* escape wheel shaft (but no pinion needed)
* pallet fork
* pallet fork shaft
* pallet pins

And then I can try to turn it by hand, and work out whether/how to proceed.

## Frame plates

I'm going to do straightforward CAM, with no separate finishing passes,
and see how it looks. If it is bad I can do better, but should be fine as
none of the outside edges are really functional.

The drill holes are at:

* 0,0 (0.5mm)
* 0,7.5 (0.5mm)
* 7,3.57 (0.5mm)
* 4.94,-6.9 (2mm)

Great success.

The 4 holes in the middle were drilled to 0.5mm with the PCB drill, and then the rest
was machine with the 2mm endmill.

I used a piece of 0.5mm blue pivot steel to check the hole diameters. It did not fit at
first, so I dragged the end of it over a file to give it some rudimentary "cutting edges",
then used the pivot steel in the pin vice to work the pivots until they were large enough
for the pivot steel to spin freely. This technique worked very well.

I drilled the large hole out to 2mm with twist drills in the pin vice, and then opened it up
with a piece of "sharpened" 2mm pivot steel, as for the 0.5mm holes.

I wet-sanded the faces with the sandpaper on the piece of plywood, mainly to deburr
the edges, then wet-sanded with 1000 grit sandpaper held in the hand, and then polished with
Autosol.

There are some machining marks visible around the edges (which I haven't polished).
This may have been improved if I ran a separate finishing pass.

The Z depth was set a bit wrong on the second part, which meant the first pass was quite deep,
but it seemed to work well and made a nice chip, so I have increased the suggested depth of
cut in [micromachining.md](micromachining.md) from 0.32mm to 0.5mm.

After lunch: onto the standoffs!

The length of the central section is specified at 9.9mm but I made it at 10.0 mm (by accident).
The only effect this will have is to give 0.1mm more end-float on the shafts, which I don't care about.

There is more slop in the standoff mountings than intended, which means careful assembly will be
very important to make sure the shafts aren't binding.
