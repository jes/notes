## Self-aligning Boggle

Overnight I worked out how to make a helical ramp around the pocket that will direct the cube into the bottom.

You just need to sweep a rectangle from the centre of the pocket out to the tip of the "point", up
through a helix.

Here's a single helix that does one lap: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4867

Here's a pair of helixes that each do half a lap, in opposite directions: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4868

Having 2 half-lap helixes has the advantage that the ramp is steeper, but has an unsightly discontinuity
at the top of the ramp.

Could we make it neater by making a datum plane that passes through
the bottom of the point, and the top of the opposite side, and then project a circle onto this plane,
and sweep the rectangle through that circle?

This view shows how the "2 helixes" method results in a ramp that does not lie in a plane: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4869

Here I've put a fillet on the join and it has accomplished most of what I wanted from making the ramp lie in a plane: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4870

So I'm going to print this and see how it works.

So then we could imagine a 4x4 grid of these with the ramps intersecting, and some pyramid like "spikes" in the corners between them.
Then wherever a cube lands, the pyramids push it in to a pocket, and the ramps make the pointy corner spiral into the right orientation,
and the problem is totally solved! What could go wrong?

OK, a better idea than the datum plane ti get a planar ramp is to start by making the pocket, cut it with a triangle to make the ramp,
and then build the rest of it around it.

Also I realised that I'm setting my sights too low. I'm not trying to make a shape where it's easy to get the cubes into the right
orientation. I'm trying to make a shape where it's *hard to get them to stay in the wrong orientation*.
