The 1mm wire arrived today, I installed it and tested it, seems to work a lot better, it needs a lot more drive torque, which
is exactly what I wanted.

If anything it is too stiff, ticks too quickly.

Another problem is it slips in the clamps if the amplitude gets too high. It might help to file flats on the spring for the clamps
to attach to.

I'm annoyed by all the fluttering, I'm going to increase the locking safety margin again and see how it goes.

I think increaseing the safety margin on the lock is maybe counter-productive. A larger safety margin means you're applying the impulse
later in the swing. But it's obvious from flicking the lever back and forth by hand that you put the most energy into the system by applying
the impulse as early as possible, and we know that for isochronism you want the impulse at the centre of the swing. So applying
the impulse *late* is not helpful.

I'm saying that a late impulse gives low amplitude, which gives low velocity at the time of escaping, which gives flutter.

So maybe the plan is to go back to an anchor that delivers the impulse much closer to the centre, and see if it works properly
when started with sufficient amplitude. I don't care if it flutters on low amplitude as long as I can start it with a higher amplitude
and it can sustain the higher amplitude.
