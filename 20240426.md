## Misc

Plans:

 * Cut hair
 * Cut grass
 * Start growing the mushroom kit
 * Measure out for the robot ramp and start digging away at whatever is in the way
 * More gluing on the CNC machine

## Robot ramp

OK, we laid out the boundary wire in a narrow strip to check that the robot could handle it, and it can't. It keeps
trying to turn around halfway along as soon as it senses one of the wires.

Solution 1: make some custom electronics, with a proximity sensor on each side, make the ramp have tall walls,
and then when the electronics detects a wall close by on both sides it takes over control of the motors and just
steers it to drive in a straight line and try to keep in the centre of the walls. Once one of the walls
disappears it returns control of the motors to the normal controller.

Solution 2: make the ramp out of "channels" that the wheels drop into, and that way as soon as it gets on the ramp it can't go anywhere but drive in a straight line to the end.

Solution 3: get a second robot.
