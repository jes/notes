## Isoform

Let's try and add a "thickness" operation. It should let you say whether the thickness
is inside, outside, or centred on the existing surface.

"Delete this" on a subtraction is deleting the second child instead of reparenting
it to the parent.

It's because I was passing a reference to the `node.children` array, which they're
then getting deleted from, so the length changes mid-loop as they're being added
to the new parent. Solution is to shallow clone the array.

There is some sort of glitch if you have a Transform node with no children, or if
you disable a Transform node, and it is a child of a smooth union.

I think the issue is that smooth union of some shape and a noop is broken, instead
of just being the one shape. Is it just a numerical error because the `noopShaderCode()` is such a large number? Yes, I think so. Reducing the `noopShaderCode()` from
10000042.0 to 142.0 has fixed it.

But that is not ideal because you might want features bigger than 142 mm, and the "noop"
object should never appear to be closer to the surface, for example when applying
a thickness.

Cursor has solved it by adding explicit tests to the combinators to see if the child
code is noop code, and skipping over the child if so.

When it is recompiling the shader it lags the user interface. We should try to do
that in a web worker or something?

Ah, but I don't think you're allowed to do web workers with a local HTML file.

OK, it's even easier than that. You just sprinkle `async` and `await` around and
it magically works!

For some reason we're recompiling the shader again when you click off the property editor.
The document is getting marked dirty.

The PropertyEditor is calling `onPropertyChanged()` when you remove focus.

One fun idea is we could bundle the entire application with saved work, and then give you
the option to load it up in the same version that saved it, even if breaking changes are made
in the "real" version.

## SDF Computations

I'm implementing JavaScript versions of the SDFs. This has meant bringing in `vec3.js`
and `mat3.js`, and I also need to make sure that all of the "vector" properties of
the nodes are actual `Vec3` objects.

Once I have finished adding JavaScript implementations, it might be good to have a toggle
to turn on software rendering, just to check that the JavaScript implementations
are correct.

And then we can do things like:

 * ray march the cursor location in JavaScript to work out the coordinates under the cursor
 * marching cubes to create STL files

But actually, thinking a bit more... we could definitely export the depth under the cursor
via the fragment shader one way or another - could we get the GPU to do
marching cubes?? Then we only need the GLSL implementation of the SDF and no duplicate
JavaScript one.

1. make a texture big enough to cover every point inside the 3d bounding volume
2. use a fragment shader to evaluate each of those points and put the results into the texture (we only need 1 bit per vertex, so can do maybe 24 vertices per pixel)
3. read vertices out of the texture and do marching cubes in JavaScript?

If you wanted to evaluate the shader at every 0.01mm inside a 100mm cube, you'd have
10^12 evaluations, which at 24 vertices per pixel would be about 200000x200000 pixels, or
5000x 4K frames. If we are at 60 fps rendering 4K then this would take 83 seconds.

Is there a better option than evaluating the SDF at every vertex within the space? Can we
make the vertices denser where the SDF is closer to 0?

This reddit thread talks about Octrees for SDFs: https://www.reddit.com/r/VoxelGameDev/comments/ontjdf/how_is_sdf_stored_in_a_octree/

>  The SDF is, as you say, a continuous function. Continuous functions can be approximated by interpolating values on discrete intervals (grid etc.).
> 
> So we set an acceptable error value, start by constructing our octree with the first 8 nodes, sample, check the interpolated values at the positions of the child nodes, and if the error is too large we refine the node by creating the child nodes and adding the real values, then repeat. 

So let's say we start out with our octree being a single cube that contains our entire
object. Evaluate the SDF at the corners, then split the cube into 8 child cubes, and
evaluate the SDF at the new corners. If all of the new evaluations are within some
acceptable tolerance of the interpolation of the parent cube evaluations, then we discard
the child cubes and stop. Otherwise recurse until some limit. And then you have a sparse
voxel octree of your SDF, and when you do marching cubes on the sparse voxel octree you
have much fewer vertices to deal with.

How do we do that on the GPU? Apparently compute shaders are available in WebGL 2. So I
should hold off on JavaScript versions of the SDFs, might be able to do it all on GPU.
Maybe compute shaders aren't available, I am reading conflicting information.

WebGPU is the successor to WebGL apparently, but it is not yet available in Firefox.
However it would be possible to ditch the model of running in the browser and instead
run in Electron.

Another idea is can we compile GLSL to JavaScript? Then we can run marching cubes or
whatever in JavaScript, but not have to provide 2 implementations of the SDFs.

## Anti-aliasing

I'm going to try to get Cursor to make the fragment shader do multi-sampling anti-aliasing.

After (4x4 MSAA):

Good.

## Sketcher workflow

A polycurve is like a polygon except it can have arc segments.

A sketch is a bunch of 2d polycurves that the user can manipulate by dragging the
associated vertices.

(Later on we'll add a constraint solver to the sketch system).

If all of the 2d polycurves are actually closed, then the sketch is "valid" and then
we can make a 2d SDF of it.

We can attach the sketch to a plane.

With the sketch attached to a plane we then turn it into a solid either with a linear extrusion or a revolve. (Later on we might be able to sweep along a path composed of polycurve parts). To do a "pocket" we'll just make a positive part and then use Subtraction.

So we'll need:

 * a way to define planes to attach the sketch to
 * a way to define the polycurves as a 2d sketch
 * turn a 2d sketch into a 2d SDF (Quilez)
 * turn a 2d SDF into a 3d SDF (Quilez)

So let's just hardcode the planes to XY/XZ/YZ, and hardcode an initial polycurve?

Current status is I have committed code to implement this but it's not working properly.

So:

 * decide whether I actually want JavaScript `sdf()` functions, revert the previous commit if not
 * fix the SketchNode

## Flywheel truck

I'm going to see if I can print a new set of gears that will fix the ratio.

And, watching myself work, I'm using:

 * opacity so that I can see internal features of a part
 * involute gear tool

I think I can safely go up from 10 teeth to 19 teeth on the pinions, which
would mean going down from 40 to 31 on the larger gears. So that's changing from 4x
ratio to 1.63x ratio. Two lots of that changes from 16x to 2.66x, which reduces the
overall ratio from 64:1 to 10.64:1, which is about what ChatGPT said we want.

I did have trouble installing the pinion on the flywheel shaft last time, so I'm
going to shift stuff around a bit to make it easier.

Printing these 3: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6035

I'm not going to bother switching to the 0.2mm nozzle.

Whoa, it works!

So good. I should have listened to ChatGPT in the first place.

## Isoform todo

### General-purpose SDF evaluation

 * decide whether I can get away with only having GLSL SDF implementations
 * if so: sketch out a GLSL sparse voxel octree generator & revert the commit that added them
 * if not: fix all the JavaScript SDF implementations (including make sure everything is a Vec3 where it needs to be)
 * show the coordinates of the surface under the cursor
 * marching cubes to make an STL file

### Sketcher workflow

 * fix the SketchNode so the test shape works
 * make the SketchNode just do a 2d SDF, and make a separate PadNode and RevolveNode that turn it 3d
 * a quick and dirty 2d sketch editor
 * a way to view the SDF "rings" in the sketcher
 * for unclosed shapes, every distance is an external distance (but maybe we don't support this?)
 * allow creating datum points/lines/planes
 * allow "attaching" sketches to datum planes
 * allow padding along a datum line
 * allow filleting at top or bottom of Pad, and separate radii on each?
 * allow draft angle on Pad
 * constraint solver

### Performance

 * only `requestAnimationFrame()` if the pan/zoom/document etc. has changed, no need to redraw the same frame over and over again
 * progressively adjust image quality if the frames are too quick or too slow (if too slow: MSAA can go down, resolution can go down slightly, max. steps can go down; if too fast: step factor can go down)
 * make each node compute its bounding box, and use this to do domain repetition in the pattern modifiers (would bounding spheres be better or worse?)
 * show shader compile time, and frame render time instead of fps

### UX

 * draggable Transform node
 * show local origin & axes when rendering secondary node
 * some way to make the secondary node stick on even when clicked off
 * some way to stop rendering the whole document and just act as if the root is some other node, probably grey out the rest of the tree when this is done, as if the rest were "Disabled"
 * save/load your work
 * expose shader compilation warnings to the user
 * allow reduced opacity, start raymarching through the internal space by reversing the distances
 * should `smoothK` be renamed to `blendRadius`? `filletRadius`? If it doesn't act like a radius, can we make it one? If not, what else should we call it?

### Parametric design

 * allow defining formulae for properties, separately from evaluating expressions
 * formulae can reference properties of other objects (force displayName to be unique?)
 * allow defining new parameters in a VarSet or something

### New primitives

 * involute gear
 * bend
 * Groove combinator? Can be additive or subtractive, https://forgedthoughts.com/modeling/booleans/index.html
 * text

### Research areas

 * how can you do chamfering? (Yes! `if (abs(d1) < k && abs(d2) < k) return d1+d2-k; else return min(d1,d2);` - is this sound? can we do something similar for `roundRadius`?)
 * can we do targeted fillets/chamfers?
 * can we do the thing I mentioned yesterday where we somehow use domain deforming functions to deform the *locations* of a Pattern (translation and rotation), but still use the un-deformed child tree but just place them at those locations?
