## Escapements

Yesterday I mentioned the idea of an "escapement" where a pendulum is powered by a crank, and
by chance I stumbled across this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgTg4eoje-I which has
a pendulum with a crank on it!

That example actually has the pendulum powered by a separate (Galileo?) escapement, and the pendulum is
driving the crank, but the connection between the crank and the pendulum is exactly what
I had in mind. I imagine that if you removed the escapement and hung the weight off
the wheel with the crank, it would drive the pendulum.
