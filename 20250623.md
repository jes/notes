## Tractor

Steering box mounted:

It is indeed possible to install it by inserting each half separately and bolting them together after.

You can see one of the bolt holes is not very good, never mind, probably not a problem.

I also started making the track rods (?): https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6235

But my M8 die is broken so I have ordered another one, should be able to thread the ends tomorrow evening.

And then other jobs are:

 * make the adapter for the sprocket
 * cut the rear axle to length
 * turn the ends of the rear axle to fit inside the wheels
 * thread the ends of the rear axle
 * machine/grind flats on the ends of the rear axle
 * take the steering box back out and make the real version of the "input shaft"
