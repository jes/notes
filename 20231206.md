## Engraving

I re-generated the g-code for the dials without using "Break apart" in Inkscape, but it still
does a retract after every tiny line segment. Not sure what to do about that, maybe there is a
better CAM program to use.

This time the paint is balling up on the end of the tool: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5086

Even though it has had several days to dry. Maybe it is just a thicker layer this time? Maybe it's
been too cold for the paint to dry properly?

Pretty unacceptable: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5087

For the second one I reseated the collet and it is going a bit better, so I think part of the
problem was run-out.
