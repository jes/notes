## Clamping piece

First job was putting the M1.6 threaded holes in the leg of the gauge, and making a clamping
piece.

I made this clamping piece by hand:

I'm pretty sure I marked the holes in the brass piece more accurately than this, so the
drill must have wandered. Still, good practice at filing very small parts.

Next I'll try making it on the CNC router...

## Scale

So next up is making up artwork for a scale. I think I want to take a bunch of measurements of the jaws open to
different sizes, and the corresponding distance between the pointer and the brass clamp, and then set up
those reference marks in Inkscape or similar, and interpolate all the other marks. The marks can't all be spaced
equally because we're really measuring the chord length, rather than the arc length, at the jaws.

But before that, the handmade jaw probably wants filing to a better shape. Actually maybe both parts want some more
"finishing" now, so that I don't take the scale out of calibration later.
