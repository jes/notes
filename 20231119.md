## 1x plastic escapement

I'm reprinting the broken parts.

## Garage

I'm going to start rearranging stuff, in particular I want to get the milling machine into its new position.

I must remember to fix the roof leaks.

OK, I've took all the stuff off the shelf in the back left corner, and dusted off the shelf and moved
it next to the pillar drill, dusted off the walls and swept the floor and vacuumed the cobwebs off the
ceiling in that corner, and moved the milling machine into its new position.

I still need to move the control cabinet, and I want to put it higher up this time.
