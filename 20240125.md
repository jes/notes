## G-code sender

I've got about an hour to work on this. I want to do:

 * ctrl-Z to undo WCO changes
 * save/restore coordinate system
 * look at opening a system file browser with Gio

Mostly straightforward. I don't know if I should be using some config file library, but I just wrote my own for now.

Opening a system file browser is easy with https://pkg.go.dev/gioui.org/x/explorer but not obvious how to make it a modal, and long-term I want my own file selector that is more keyboard-friendly.
