## Tractor

Current status is I have made a metal plate to bolt the layshaft and motor to. With slotted holes for chain
adjustment. The plate is bolted to the chassis.

I made the slots in the steel plate on the kitchen-worktop CNC machine, it worked really well. Great machine.
It's the machine I always dreamed of having access to!

So yesterday I managed to successfully drive the tractor for the first time with no failures, which is a good
milestone.

I need to put spacers on the rear axle, and then some sort of split pin or something to hold the wheels on.
And then trim the axle to final length.
I was driving it around with no spacers and no split pin and the wheels didn't fall off, so I think the
side load on the split pins will be very minor.

And then that's the drivetrain done! Next up would be the steering tower thing. Ideally this would overlap
the edges of the chassis, but the steering shafts stick out the sides, I don't think it's convenient
to attach anything there. So then what? I think we make it like its own box, and then screw the box down to
the top surface of the chassis, and once it's in place fit some steel straps to the sides just to hold it down
a bit stronger.
