## 3d-printed escapement

First job: make a better spring, out of the piano wire.

It is way too hard to install these springs in the collets. I'm going to look up how normal watches do it and try
something closer to that. Oh, maybe an assortment of tapered brass pins would be handy. Though maybe I'd
need a tapered reamer as well.

I'm browsing on "Cousins UK" and there is some quite interesting stuff, including:

 * clock hairspring assortment, with collets: https://www.cousinsuk.com/product/hairsprings-clock
 * pulleys: https://www.cousinsuk.com/category/pulleys
 * wheel blanks: https://www.cousinsuk.com/product/wheel-blanks

I'm getting the hairspring assortment and a set of tapered pins. It's probably that this stuff will all be
too big for the watch, but at least might be useful for larger models.

I found this picture: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4993

Definitely looks like the spring is pinned into the collet.

I've stuck it in the side of the collet by heating with a soldering iron: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4994

I'm trying to coil it up now. I could really do with those 3-pronged pliers from yesterday, spring-loaded please.

Could I 3d-print a forming tool that would slip over the Lindstrom pliers?

Maybe?

56 minutes with 0.25mm nozzle, or 12 minutes with 0.6mm nozzle. I'll time how long it takes to change the nozzle.

Starting at 6:24:30. Finished 6:26:58. So if the tools are already next to the printer it takes about 2m30s to change
the nozzle. Not bad. I noticed if you remove the nozzle while it's only at 120 deg. C or so, the plastic comes off much more
cleanly, instead of staying stuck to the inside of the nozzle.

Also, it's worth pre-heating the bed while changing the nozzle so that you don't have to wait for it to heat once you've
changed it.

Maybe!

Pretty decent: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4997

This tool works *really* well. So much easier than trying to use 2 pairs of pliers. I might have put too many coils on this
spring, but I can always shortern it if necessary. Let's try and install it and see how it ticks.

Yeah, I reckon too many turns, it is way too weak. Also the amplitude is still pretty low. Not enough to lock properly.
If I pull on the string harder it just stalls on the lock. So, let's take 1 turn off the spring.

Maybe locking is too ambitious. Maybe I should make it "dead-beat" instead of lock, and then it can cope with a wider
range of amplitudes? Although, maybe the lock is required if the lever is able to detach.

Oh, actually, maybe I have worked out why it keeps stopping:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4998

At this point, both pallets are in contact simultaneously! How has this happened? Did I blunder the scaling? Or is
it just broken? This is just as it is unlocking the discharging pallet.

Ugh, the problem exists in CAD too: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5000

How did I miss this?

First check is to overlay & scale the `metal-escapement-2` version of the pallet fork in Gimp and see if all the holes line up.

Yes, looks like they line up: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5001

So the metal escapement was never going to work very well either, and it is a miracle that the previous plastic
version did!

I also think part of it is due to poor tolerances. Because if you look at the screenshot and imagine the escape wheel
is trying to turn clockwise, it *could* actually work fine. It is moving clear of the entry pallet and providing impulse
to the discharging pallet. It just has zero clearance.

So one problem is I need to modify something about the escapement to give it more clearance.

The other thing is: how long would I expect the balance wheel to keep swinging back and forth if the pallet fork
is removed? I think Harrison said 10 minutes in "Concerning Such Mechanism". Mine swings for about 5 seconds.
I can see the spring is rubbing against the frame a bit, can try and fix that.

Tweaking the spring and oiling the pivots (but... lol, I think this has no effect) has got it up to 10 seconds.

I'm going to take another turn off the spring and see what happens. It might stop quicker because the spring restores
it to the centre more strongly, or because it will run faster which will make it experience more friction,
or it might stop slower because it has more stored energy.

Maybe spins for 11 or 12 seconds, maybe no different.

I set it going with a bit more weight (this time the room spray bottle plus the colourful allen keys) and it
actually goes really well... interspersed with going really poorly. At times it exhibits amplitudes in excess of
180 degrees, which is very satisfying. It is obviously working well when it does this, the escapement locks nicely,
the balance swings freely, etc. But then the amplitude drops almost to nothing, and it sometimes stalls.

Things I noticed:

 * the gear teeth can bind up
 * the impulse pin can jump out of the slot
 * the amplitude varies wildly

Do the teeth always skip at the same place relative to peak amplitude? If so, this would suggest that both the
drop in amplitude & the skipping teeth are both caused by eccentricity of the escape wheel.

I should have marked the barrel and the escape wheel so that I could tell if effects were synchronised with one or the other. I
can do that by counting teeth in a pinch.

I recorded a video, timestamps for reference:

 * first failed lock of entry pallet: 00:26:06
 * next successful lock of entry pallet: 00:37:24 (7 teeth later)

At 00:26:06, the balance wheel has only swung to about 45 degrees. This means the cause of the failed lock was before this,
i.e. it didn't get enough impulse, or it lost too much energy.

So the next good lock is 7 teeth later, and the next failed lock is another 7 teeth after that! That's close enough to 13 that I
would suspect it is sync'd with the escape wheel rotation. If I spin the escape wheel on its own, can I see any run-out in its
teeth? Yes, looks like maybe 1mm difference between high and low.

Measuring with the Vernier caliper from the opposite side of the shaft to the tips of the teeth, I measure a range from
20.8mm to 21.5mm. It is visibly crooked. I think reprint this part and try to put it on square.

Actually, before that, I heated it up with a lighter and squared it up a bit. It looks a bit better now. Maybe. Let's see how
it runs. Much better! But still not adequate.

I think the property where the pallet pin lands on the corner of the tooth instead of squarely on the locking face is
a bug. I will try and modify the pallet fork so that at the point of leaving the impulse face on one pallet, it lands on
the *locking* face of the other pallet.

Well, this was a lot of work: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5002

I still don't know the best way to constrain the sketch with the layout of the pallets so that it acts symmetrically.
I'll print it and give it a go, it doesn't obviously look like it's going to make a lot of difference though.

I reckon it works a bit better, not really clear. I think the problem might be that the balance wheel spends too much
time unlocking the escapement compared to receiving impulse. Maybe I increase the "base circle" of the escape wheel, so
that the locking face gets shorter?

I recorded a new video clip to measure how much amplitude is spent on each phase of movement:

From a total swing of 275 degrees, it spent approximately:

 * 100 degrees free
 * 40 degrees unlocking
 * 25 degrees receiving impulse
 * 110 degrees free on the other side

(Also, at these high amplitudes, it does unlock the escapement again a bit towards the end of the swing. But that's not my
biggest issue at the moment, and it can easily be solved by widening the slot.)

So this is msotly good! It spends almost the entire time free of the escapement, the only issue is that it spends
almost twice as long unlocking the escapement as receiving impulse, which naively sounds like it is wasting
more energy than it is gaining. Obviously not the case because it *does* run, but let's try and reduce the amount of time
spent on unlocking, by making the base circle of the escape wheel larger and leaving everything else alone.

The length of the flat portion of the locking face was previously about 0.95mm, I'll reduce it to 0.5mm.

Also, I can repeat the measurement of how many degrees it spends on each phase, but in CAD, to see if it matches reality...

 * 90 degrees free
 * 48 degrees unlocking
 * 33 degrees receiving impulse
 * 104 degrees free on the other side

So that is pretty close, given that I had to measure the video to the precision of 1 frame. So that's encouraging.

And now let's repeat the measurement in CAD using the new escape wheel.

The new escape wheel is also going to need a new
pallet fork, because it only moves by about +/- 9 degrees instead of 11 now, so the slot is not wide enough.

With the new escape wheel, it is free for an extra 15 degrees, and unlocking for 15 degrees less. So now, with a swing
of 275 degrees, starting from max. clockwise position:

 * 105 degrees free
 * 35 degrees unlocking
 * 33 degrees receiving impulse
 * 104 degrees free on the other side

Oh, and does it behave the same on the reverse swing? i.e. starting from the position that ended at and returning to
max. clockwise? We get:

 * 88 degrees free
 * 34 degrees unlocking
 * 28 degrees receiving impulse
 * 125 degrees free on the other side

So, yeah, not symmetrical, and still spending more time on unlocking than on impulse, and in this direction it is
even worse.

Note we don't necessarily want to maximise the amount of impulse it receives. I think we would prefer to keep the
total impulse as small as possible, and deliver it all at exactly the 0 degrees position. And similarly we would
prefer to keep the unlocking force as small as possible, and deliver it all at exactly 0 degrees.

I'm tempted to print the new escape wheel with the 0.25mm nozzle. Not the pallet fork because that's too big,
so let's widen the slot in the pallet fork, print the pallet fork with 0.6mm, then print the new escape wheel
with 0.25mm.

Fuck, FreeCAD segfaulted while I was doing that, so frustrating. Try again after lunch. Also, why is the file
picker so slow in FreeCAD?
