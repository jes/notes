## Partners in Crime

We've played a lot of "Partners in Crime" but the word list is getting old,
need to think of new words. A good word is something that has multiple meanings,
a lot of them tend to be both a verb and an unrelated noun.
Existing words include:

 * record
 * bat
 * tap
 * wave

Other good ideas would be words that are really hard to represent, and homophones,
because even if they aren't spelt the same you might still work out what your
partner has drawn. Also words that are similar but different, for example
"noise" and "sound" might confuse each other.

We'd also want a way to shuffle the deck without unpairing the pairs. And a
way to do scoring that is more convenient.

I'm working on a list here: https://github.com/jes/partners-in-crime-wordlist

## Isoform

I'm going to do a bit of a tidy up:

 * the tree stuff should all go under `nodes/`, and then that directory is kind of a "CAD kernel" independent of the GUI
 * the tree view and property editor should be individual components
 * write a .cursorrules that explains the architecture?

Good, done.

I wonder if I can get Cursor to make drag-and-drop of the tree view for me?

Wicked, it's working!

So I am now able to drop a node *on* another node, but I still can't drop them
*between* other nodes to reorder the tree.

Meh, can't figure it out.

Let's try and sort out the view rotation then. It works fine except that the X axis
is always horizontal, because it only lets you rotate left/right and up/down, never
round and round. And secondly I think even if you do try to rotate round and round
you get a gimbal lock and it doesn't work properly.

I made it store a rotation matrix and apply rotations to this matrix, works much
better now. I'm still not convinced it works as well as FreeCAD does, but it is
better than it was before.

I've also made panning work at 1:1 ratio instead of randomly moving the object further
than you drag.

Let's add viewing pane switching. Also may be a good time to get floating toolbars
in the viewport?
