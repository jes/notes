## Stepper motor clock

I found the clock stopped on 9:38, and not running. I nudged the motor
and it started up again. It seemed to be caught in the "hook", maybe I need
to revert to an ordinary Geneva drive, and put a ratchet near the motor
to catch the pin if it goes backwards.

OK, it just happened again, and I happened to be watching. The pin was
driving the Genega-driven wheel in the correct direction. The Geneva-driven
wheel then jumped *forwards* on its own (maybe it passed a tight spot, maybe
random), which then left the pin in the hook, and the motor stalled as the pin
tried to exit the hook "downwards".

So yeah I think the hook idea just doesn't work. I'll print a normal
Geneva-driven wheel, and then look at CAD'ing a ratchet.

There are some definite tight spots in the interaction between first pinion
and second wheel, so I'll try to make the first pinion a bit smaller.

The problem is that PrusaSlicer wants to make it like this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4931

Just one wall and no infill.

I printed it with ironing, just to try it out, it looks pretty good (not visible in pic).

With the pinion reduced to module 1.4 it feels like the tight spots are gone.

Of course it now has the problem that it can run backwards, so I need to make the ratchet.

Something like this? https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4933

The pin should be able to bend it down but not up, so it will stall the motor if the motor
is running backwards.

I haven't printed this yet because the 3d printer is busy, but I just got back and found the clock running backwards,
so it is definitely necessary. I don't know whether the power went off briefly (but not enough
to switch the computer off?) or whether the motor stalled for some other reason. But yeah, definitely
needs the ratchet, and probably will still lose time anyway if it is randomly stalling.

## Travel plan

My best options are:

 * set off at 07:10, ride to Westbury, get the train, arrive at 10:10
 * set off at 07:45, ride to Chippenham, get the train, arrive at 11:05
 * set off at 08:30, ride to Frome, get the train, arrive at 11:30
 * set off at any time, ride all the way, arrive in about 3 hours just the same

Advantages of train:

 * can potentially do some laptop work
 * don't need to worry about rain or heavy traffic
 * motorbike won't get nicked
 * don't need to navigate the roads in London

Advantages of motorbike:

 * can set off whenever I want
 * don't need to worry about delays/cancellations
 * don't need to worry about finding a seat on a packed train
 * don't need to navigate train stations

## SCAMP

I have got SCAMP out and set it up on the desk. Still todo:

 * install new microcode
 * install new bootrom
 * install new OS
 * do a simple run-through of downloading an Advent of Code problem, writing a solution, testing it, etc.

And I'd maybe like to design a bank-switching system. If it is simple I might be able to get it installed
before Advent of Code starts. I have 25 days. It might be fun to write the kernel code for it within SCAMP/os,
and video it.
