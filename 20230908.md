## Escapement

First thing, I modelled the weird 3-arm escapement: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4614

And waiting for it to print. That's a fun distraction but not necessarily relevant to the watch project.

It works but not very well, and is very sensitive to the positioning of the weights: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VKekXIMRhg

I think it would work a lot better if the "balance wheel" were actually balanced.

I think next things to look at on the watch are:

 * make some higher-quality gears and shafts at final scale
 * cut a pinion on to a shaft (how?)
 * wind up a scrap mainspring and see how its torque varies
 * see if there is any geometric modification to the (good, not 3-arm) escapement prototype that can make its tick rate more constant under varying torque

## Better gears

Here's the process I want to use:

 * put the brass rod in the 16mm collet in the lathe
 * face off the end nicely
 * part off a disc over-length
 * put the superglue arbor in the 15mm collet in the lathe
 * stick the faced end of the disk to the arbor, reasonably central
 * turn to final diameter
 * face to thickness
 * bore
 * transfer the collet chuck to the 4th axis
 * use the dial indicator to measure concentricity error
 * cut some teeth
 * remove from the superglue arbor
 * sand/polish

Wish me luck!
