## Anniversary clock

I've done some more thinking on an "anniversary clock"-style balance wheel.

Traditionally I think they use a flat spring in torsion as the "hairspring", but
instead of having to mess about with spring steel, what if we instead had the balance
wheel suspended from 2 strings that are separated by a small distance? As the strings twist around
each other, they'll raise the balance wheel up, and as they untwist they'll drop it down again.

A bit like the spinning button toy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirligig

And we'd put some equivalent of "banking pins" to stop the lever part from moving too far, and
then it just operates a normal escapement. But just like you can test a pendulum without having
an associated escapement, I think I can test this without an associated escapement.

I'll 3d print these parts:

A ball-race bearing goes between them. I think this is necessary, because otherwise the force
from hitting the banking will displace the string horizontally, which is not what we want.
The friction from the bearing won't be a very big deal, because it doesn't move very far.
The motion of the balance wheel is not mediated by the bearing, only the motion of the lever.

The housing is meant to be held in a vice, and then you manually wind up the string and let it settle
vertically, then let the balance wheel go and measure the time taken for the lever to flip from one
side to the other, and back, etc. - if the time is quite consistent then it is viable for a clock.

And then I don't know if it is enough to suspend the balance wheel directly from the lever (supported
by the bearing) or whether it needs to be suspended from above, and just have the strings pass
through the lever. Maybe suspending from above is better because then there's much less weight
on the bearing.

Other questions:

 * does the cord material matter?
 * is it preferable for the holes to be further apart or closer together?
 * what if the hole spacing at the balance wheel does not match the spacing at the lever?
 * how can you tune the period?

Intuitively I would say the cord material *does* matter. You want it to behave the same regardless of temperature,
humidity, etc., and you don't want it to sag over time. And you don't want string-to-string friction as it
winds up. Maybe a metal wire is best? At that point are we just approximating a flat spring-steel suspension?
Maybe, but that's probably OK.

I think if the hole spacing at the balance wheel does not match the spacing at the lever, then the string will twist
around itself preferentially at the end where the spacing is smallest. After that is used up it will have to move
down the string. So I think the effect is to reduce the period in the long arcs. If we find that it is slow in the long
arcs, then separating the holes at one end might be able to help!

And intuitively I think that as the holes get closer together the "lifting" effect is reduced. I think if it lifts
faster then it will tick faster, so if you want it to tick slowly you want the holes close together.

So you can tune the period by:

 * changing hole spacing
 * changing balance wheel moment of inertia
 * changing length of string (?)

Now I need a balance wheel for this thing. I think just a plastic disc with various options for hole spacing, and
provision to put M6 bolts around the perimeter.
