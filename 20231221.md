## Pocket watch

Predictably, the watch had stopped when I got to it, but it started again with a bit of a kick. If
I had put the hands on it I might have an idea of how long it ran for.

Measurements:

### Plates

* Plate thickness: 0.8mm
* Gap between plates: 5.0mm
* Total thickness from thickest points: 8.5mm
* Outer diameter of movement: 45mm

### Screws

* Movement screws: 1.5mm diameter, 2.6mm thread length, 2.5mm head diameter, 0.7mm head thickness
* Dial screws: 1.2mm diameter, 2.3mm thread length, 1.8mm head diameter, 0.5mm head thickness

### Mainspring barrel

* Outer diameter, incl. teeth: 21.5mm
* Height incl. both end caps: 4.0mm
* Pivot diameter: 1.7mm
* Number of turns for a full wind:  5.5, if 40 hour runtime

### Train

(Possibly wrong nomenclature, I've ordered them starting at the barrel and ending at the escape wheel).

* Mainspring barrel to first wheel pinion: 58:8
* First wheel to second wheel pinion: 60:8
* Second wheel to third wheel pinion: 48:6
* Third wheel to escape wheel pinion: 48:6

As a sanity check:

Minute hand is on first wheel, so barrel turns once every `58/8` = 7.25 hours.
Second hand is on third wheel, which turns `(60*48)/(8*6)` = 60 times slower than minute hand.
Escape wheel turns `48/6` = 8 times slower than second hand, which means it completes one turn every 7.5 seconds, or 2 teeth per second.

* Mainspring barrel output tooth module: ~0.35
* First wheel output tooth module: ~0.30
* Second wheel output tooth module:  ~0.30
* Third wheel output tooth module: ~0.30

* First wheel pivots: 0.9mm
* Second wheel pivots: 0.5mm diameter on 1mm shaft
* Third wheel pivots: 0.5mm diameter on 1mm shaft

### Balance

* Outer diameter: 15mm
* Thickness of balance wheel: 0.7mm
* Width of balance wheel rim: 1.5mm
* Tick rate: 2 Hz cycle, 14400 bph

### Escapement

* Escape wheel diameter: 10.0mm
* Escape wheel teeth: 15
* Distance between pallet pins: 5.0mm
* Pallet pin diameter:  0.3mm
* Impulse pin diameter: 0.6mm
* Slot width: 0.65mm
* Distance of impulse pin from balance wheel shaft: 1.4mm
* Pivot separation between escape wheel and lever: ~5.9mm
* Pivot separation between lever and balance wheel: ~10mm
* Pivots: 0.4mm diameter on 1mm shaft.

## My mainspring barrel

I was wondering about making a mainspring barrel by coiling up dozens of turns of the piano wire inside a very thin case,
and letting it spin comparatively fast. Having the barrel spin fast is an advantage because it reduces the ratio
required in the train to the escape wheel, and therefore reduces the torque required. It does mean you need more ratio
to the hand though.

The wire would fix to the outer barrel by poking through a hole in the end cap, and fix to the inner shaft by poking through
a cross-hole.

Since a barrel constructed this way would be very thin, you could let it cover the entire bottom surface of the movement
(or top surface, for improved exhibition caseback viewing), and transfer its "fast" output into the main body of the
movement with the central shaft, then have a counter-wheel to slow it down once and then a wheel on the hand to slow
it down again, and the "fast" shaft is then only sped up with a very short train to drive the escapement.

I think I should make a barrel like this just for the experience if nothing else.

A 45mm area with 4mm shaft would give 20.5mm radius available for turns, and 0.25mm wire would fit 82 turns, which would
be a length of 3155mm. I only have wire in 1m lengths so I'd probably only get about 25 turns. For a 12-hour runtime it
would have to turn no faster than once every 30 mins.

This eBay listing has a good range of piano wire: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/255953572857 - lengths from 1m to 9m, and
diameter from 0.14mm to 1.6mm.

## Movement layout

So I now have three contenders for the movement layout, depending on how the mainspring barrel works:

1. Hollow barrel
2. Traditional barrel
3. Thin barrel

### 1. Hollow barrel

This is what I've been laying out in CAD so far, something like this:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5113

For 12000 bph.

Pros:

 * minimises the number of gears required
 * driving the hand is trivial

Cons:

 * maybe too much friction on motion of inner barrel, unless complicated pivots
 * not a lot of diameter to play with
 * needs to let at least one (probably two) gears run "underneath" the bezel, so will end up quite thick

### 2. Traditional barrel

Let's take the mainspring barrel out of the pocket watch, and say we get 4 turns in 12 hours, so it turns once every 3 hours.
So the centre-hour-hand needs to mesh off the barrel output  and have 4x as many teeth so that it turns
4x slower.

Since the pocket watch's output gear has 60 teeth, we can't fit 4x as many on the hand wheel, so we'll add a second
gear to the output.

The pocket watch barrel ends up 12mm away from our centre, so we need some (say) module 0.3 gears with 1:4 ratio,
with 12mm between centres. I think they need to sum to 80 teeth. 16 and 64?

Barrel turns in 3 hours. First wheel turns in 21 minutes. Second wheel turns in 126 seconds. Escape wheel turns in
15.3 seconds, which is a bit over 6100 bph. Would look a bit like this:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5138

The brown part is the mainspring barrel from the pocket watch.

We could easily change all the pinions to 6 teeth, which would change it from 6100 bph to 11000 bph, which is probably OK.

Pros:

 * barrel pivots are easy

Cons:

 * more gears needed

### 3. Thin barrel

The idea with this one is we make a very thin barrel spanning almost the entire movement, and the outer is coupled directly
to the winder like in the "hollow barrel" idea, except instead of making room for the gears by making the barrel *hollow*,
we instead make the barrel *thin* and let it turn very fast.

This then implies a 2-step reduction for driving the hand, but means we don't need too much reduction for driving the escapement.

Let's say the barrel turns once in half an hour, so it is 24 turns for a complete wind. So we need a factor of 24 slow-down
to drive the hand, and a factor of 240 speed-up to drive the escape wheel.

I have this much: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5140

Which has a solid disc at the bottom which would be the mainspring housing, and then the 24x reduction to the hand, which
rotates concentric with the barrel output shaft.

Still needs the 240x reduction to the escapement, which could be for example 2 lots of 15.5x reduction or 3 lots of 6.2x reduction.

Pros:

 * barrel pivots are easy
 * barrel only adds *height*, takes up no other space inside the movement body
 * barrel and mainspring are both easy to make (assuming a wire mainspring is acceptable)

Cons:

 * will take a long time to wind up (?)

## Loose threads

 * finish the "thin barrel" CAD mockup, work out how sensible it looks
 * make a "thin barrel" with wire spring
 * fix the pocket watch?
 * make the 3d-printed spring-driven runaway escapement work
 * make a metal mechanism with watch-scale gears
