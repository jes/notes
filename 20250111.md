## Anti-friction wheels

I was thinking that for the "double" anti-friction wheel blocks, instead of making them
"double", we just make the wheels more like bobbins, so they touch at the front and the back,
but are basically still just 3 wheels on 3 shafts.

So for the remontoire, catching-arm shaft, escape wheel shaft, I just need 2 blocks that
provide "double" anti-friction wheels for the escape wheel shaft and remontoire, and
a "single" for the catching-arm shaft, 51mm away.

Basically the same as before, but different bobbins, and 2 in one.

The contact points on the double bobbin are only about 13mm apart, which is a lot less
than with the micro bearing blocks,
so may not constrain the angle of the shaft as well.

Lol, I made a blunder. This is for a 10mm shaft instead of 5mm.

Also I found it is quite hard to drill the bobbins straight, but I'll worry about that
later.

I think redesign from the beginning.

 * 5mm shaft *diameter*
 * 15mm bobbin diameter
 * 4mm plate thickness
 * 25mm overall thickness
 * 3x countersunk M3 screws to bolt together
 * unused M3 threaded hole on each side, for each shaft, for fitting end-stops
