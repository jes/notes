## Odd jobs

I cut off a piece of plastic before the waste was collected, and updated the Bangle.js commute timer so that
it stops counting when the route is complete, and updates `commute.json` when you're done. I can't be bothered
adding an elapsed time timer.

I've left the mirrors on the table, must package them and buy postage.

## ER20 collet tray

I think there are 10 collets. Left one on the desk.

Great success, only took about 4 minutes to cut. It is much more efficient to get the CNC machine to cut the holes and
then cut the outside shape out with the tablesaw, instead of trying to do the outside shape with the CNC
machine as well.

## Bandsaw

I put the new bandsaw blade on, it still can't cut very fast though. I managed to do this
cut in 25 seconds: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4715 - which is probably slower than hacksawing.

I worked out that the problem is the belt is slipping on the large pulley. I tried to tension the motor, but:

The pulley deforms before the belt is tight. So let's 3d print a replacement pulley, and while we're at it
we can put make it have slightly less teeth so that it runs the blade at a more suitable speed for steel.

What speed is it currently running at?

It spins at 1460 rpm (measured with optical tachometer). The big pulley is about 146mm across, the small pulley is about
29mm across. So the big pulley spins at `29/146 * 1460 = 290 rpm`.

`C = pi * d`, so the blade does `pi * 146 mm = ~459 mm/rev`, `459 * 290 = ` **133 m/min** surface speed.

What is an ideal speed for cutting steel?

Some rando chart online ( https://www.sawblade.com/band-saw-blade-speed-and-feed-chart.cfm ) suggests
that "free machining steels" up to 1 inch thick should be cut at about 300 "surface feet per minute", which
is about **90 m/min**.

So I want my replacement pulley to be `90/133 = 67%` the size of the existing one. The existing one has 20 teeth,
so the replacement should have about 13.5 teeth, let's go with **14 teeth**. The pitch looks to be just
over 5mm, so maybe this is the 0.1" pitch belt that is so common? I'll go with that.

Just print this out in PC blend and see how we go...

Great success, works well. I can put decent tension on the belt now. I repeated the previous cut in 19
seconds, and this time it was limited by how hard I was happy pushing, rather than by how hard I could
push before the belt slipped. I'm happy with this for now. It's still not very fast at cutting though.
