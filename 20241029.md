## Sovereign Scales

It's time!

I'm just going to make one, and try to do it well.

So I need to know where I'm putting holes in the sheet, and then Gcode for:

 * bottom side score lines
 * pockets
 * slots
 * pivot holes
 * cut out

I manually wrote gcode for the score lines, based on coordinates from CAD.

Drilled mounting holes need to be at:

 * X6 Y196
 * X6 Y132
 * X38 Y132
 * X38 Y4
