## SDF CAD

What are the things SDF CAD is blocked on?

1. how can you do blends in a useful way?
2. can you make exact SDFs for boolean ops?
3. helical extrude?

I did the welding for the front axle today, it went pretty well. The welder still keeps
tripping the breaker, so annoying, don't know what is wrong. It only does it intermittently
so I just flip it back on and keep going.

The steering box doesn't work, it is much too tight.

I tried spacing the two halves apart, but then the bearing for the pinion becomes under-constrained.

I don't know if it's too tight because the large gears are too close together, or because the pinion
is too close to the centre.

Since I have a spare pinion, I experimented by facing down the back of the pinion to see if it would
mesh better, and it did, and I think I now have a configuration that works. So the plan is:

 * make the gearbox wider, add a second set of bearings to the output shafts
 * make a sort of protrusion where the steering column goes in, add a second bearing
 * print in PC-Max with "strength" settings
 * order fasteners to bolt it together
