## Stepper motor clock

It's not getting substantially hot. Obviously it would be hotter without the heatsink,
but also I could use a lower voltage.

So I consider this clock "complete", just needs a bracket for the capacitor, and assembly.

And for any more I make:

 * increase clearance around gears (increase spacing slightly)
 * increase clearance around the washer in the second wheel
 * remove the cut-out for the heatsink from the plastic cover
 * make the shafts easier to make (i.e. maybe instead of turning diameter on the lathe, we just use 5mm shaft and 3d-print spacers)
 * make the writing on the dial bigger
 * make the hands sturdier
 * make the hands sit closer together to reduce parallax
 * find a way to make the dial have more contrast
 * get a physically-smaller capacitor, and lower-voltage transformer
 * make the electrical box bigger?

But anyway, for now, a bracket for the capacitor, and "final" assembly.

Great success. Clock is Finished.

## Escapement

The issue with the binding up is indeed caused by the meshing of the gears. Even with the pallet fork removed it doesn't
spin very freely, even though both the barrel and the escape wheel spin freely if only one is installed.

So... probably reprint the escape wheel with smaller module on the pinion? Let's try module 0.7.

And then looking at the spring, I'll first try to re-bend the existing spring to see if I can make it a bit more
concentric with the shaft. It probably wants to be stronger though. (Harrison says the balance spring should be 80x
as strong as the force from the pallets, whatever that means). Meh, the spring is way too weak, need to make a stiffer one.

Actually, update: the escape wheel does *not* spin freely with the barrel removed. I've loosened the screws and it is
greatly improved now. But the teeth are still binding, so we'll have the smaller escape wheel pinion anyway.

The collet design is very bad. It's very difficult to install, because the spring always gets caught against the
end of the shaft. Need to come up with a better design for this.

Here's the current status:

I heated the wire up with a lighter and poked it through the collet. This has the module 0.7 pinion on the escape wheel,
which works well, and also the new hairspring made out of the Apico lock wire (not piano wire).

The spring force is probably better now, but the balance wheel is not heavy enough, which means it has quite low amplitude
(is that right? or have I misunderstood).

I put a lot of drive weight on it to try to increase the amplitude, and some teeth skipped and made a bad noise.
I expect it was the barrel against the escape wheel, but could have been the pallets.

I think that for a given drive force, and a given moment of inertia,
if you increase the strength of the spring, then you get a higher frequency *and* a lower amplitude. How can I check that?

Well, if you have *no* spring, and some drive force, then the wheel will go to the limit in one direction. So adding
a spring definitely decreases the distance it travels compared to no spring at all. If you imagine that it reverses once it
gets to the point that the return force from the spring exceeds the driving force then it obviously *is* the case that the amplitude
will decrease as the spring gets stiffer. So I think I'm basically right.

So I need a heavier balance wheel. Previously I have done this by making the balance wheel have holes into which I can screw bolts,
but that invariably leads to the bolts crashing into some of the other parts, causing great frustration.

I have quite a lot of 9.5mm ball bearings, so I think the plan is to make a balance wheel with a lot of holes around the
perimeter, into which I can push ball bearings, and *hopefully* they can be persuaded not to hit the balance cock.

Maybe I should have given the holes some sort of springy feature so that I have a better chance of being able to install and
remove the balls. Oh, well, I should be able to manage.

And then after this is printed, I can fit a 0.25mm nozzle and experiment with that.

Trying to think of a way to remove the balance wheel from its shaft without also disturbing the spring and collet.

Also, I worked out that I want a tool that is like a pair of pliers, except one jaw has 1 rod and the other jaw has 2 rods, like this:

For adjusting springs. You can imagine putting the pliers around a wire and squeezing them together to make the wire bend
towards the single rod.

I looked at "wire bending pliers" on Amazon, but can't see any of this design. There are a few similar ones on DuckDuckGo
image search, but I can't see where to buy them. Maybe easiest to make my own.

## 0.25mm nozzle

I installed the 0.25mm profile in PrusaSlicer, and sliced the escapement model with it at 33% scale and 0.1mm layer height:

So this is final watch scale, with module 0.4 gears, and it all looks pretty believable!
(Notwithstanding that the pallet fork is upside down).
And it says 2h15m print time, not too bad.

If I go down to 16% scale (which is about module 0.2 gears) then the gear teeth kind of disappear. But maybe module 0.4
gears is workable with 3d-printed parts.
