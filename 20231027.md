## Stepper motor clock

First job: chamfer the wheels, because they don't look like they'll be changing now. Actually
I can't be bothered, skip that.

So on to making hands and face. And the big question is does the hour wheel need an external bearing to
support it, or can it just have the internal one that locates it on the shaft? Well one bearing
isn't enough to fully constrain it. Maybe we make it stick out a bit further and put two in it? It needs
to stick out further anyway so that the hands can clear the face.

Something like this? https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4910

Note that the hands there are aligned in an impossible position - I need to check that it is actually possible
for the hands to be aligned correctly. Meh, it's close enough, the
counter-wheel is only 1 degree off, which means the minute hand will be a quarter of a degree off. It travels
6 degrees per minute, so a quarter of a degree is about 2.5 seconds.

However it does need the counter-wheel to be aligned with the third wheel and hour-wheel correctly, which may
be some trouble to physically assemble. At least it only needs doing once.

I think the transformer should be hidden in the back of the case, and covered with clear plastic or something to stop
the mains from getting touched.

And here's a start on the case: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4911
