## CAD model of house

Now with textures on the porch & dining room roof, and start of loft:

Still needs the interior walls of the loft, the main roof, and chimney cavity wants connecting.

Then decide whether to print as-is, or put a brick texture on the exterior walls.

And then once printed I can maybe make drop-in interiors, particularly for kitchen and bathroom.

## Anniversary clock

In anticipation of the thicker suspension spring arriving, plan was:

 * reduce the gap between the forks
 * make it so I can access the bolts on the fork without twisting the wire

So I really only need to make a new fork.

And I've checked it still has clearance.

Apparently the new spring is not expected until Tuesday, that's annoying. I'll have to think of something else to work on until then.
