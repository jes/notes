## Garage

I've put all the decking planks up on the wall, and some of the longer other planks, and
put the other bits of wood storage nearby: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5051

I've put a big shelf up above the workbench: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5052

And sorted out the cans, sandpaper, etc.: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5053

I'm slightly concerned that the "data" light isn't showing on the powerline ethernet
adapter, is it only within range intermittently? I may need to move it.

Next up is probably putting MDF top on the island bench and the computer desk,
and putting up some plywood for the "tool wall".

## Stepper motor clock

Some reference information for making the stepper motor clocks:

The Geneva drive pin is 2mm diameter and **20mm long**.

Shaft lengths required (all in 5mm aluminium round bar, with ~1mm chamfer at each end):

 * first wheel: **49mm**
 * second wheel: **42mm**
 * third wheel: **74mm**, with flat to depth of 1mm for **38.5mm** length
 * counter wheel: **58mm**

The frame pieces are **100mm wide**, and **120mm long** for the base and **240mm long** for the backplane.

Here's the arrangement of wheels and shafts: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5056
