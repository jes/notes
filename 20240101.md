## Mainsprings

This article explains the modern manufacturing process for mainsprings: https://www.thenakedwatchmaker.com/making-mainsprings

It uses a rolling mill to turn the round wire into flat strips.

And this PDF explains the historical process: https://theindex.nawcc.org/Articles/Blakey-MakingSprings.pdf

It has an awful lot of steps and involves a lot of laborious filing and sanding.

So I think my options are:

 * find a way to make it work with round wire
 * find a completely different way to use a spring to drive a watch (seems very unlikely)
 * find a place to buy flat strips in different widths/thicknesses (seems slightly unlikely)
 * buy ready-made mainsprings (booo)
 * buy a rolling mill (Â£130 on eBay), or make one, and learn how to use it to turn wire into consistent flat strips (seems difficult)

I actually think it could work with round wire as long as the barrel is made well enough. So I'm going to
have a fresh start at trying to make a barrel for 0.7mm wire.
