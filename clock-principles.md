# Clock principles

 * Smaller resting surface radius is better.
 * Higher amplitude is better.
 * Depthing is important.
 * Alignment of the balance shaft and escape wheel shaft is important, in all axes.
 * The relationship between period and amplitude can be affacted by the drive torque, beyond just the effect that torque has on amplitude.
