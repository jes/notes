## Deadbeat spring escapement

The new anchor didn't help. Same as the old one, it loses energy with every oscillation.

So we're saying there is too much energy lost in:

 * balance wheel pivot
 * balance spring not being a real spring
 * anchor pivot
 * friction on anchor surfaces

A normal anniversary clock has the balance wheel suspended by the spring, so there is no friction in the pivots. And the spring
is a real spring, so it doesn't lose so much energy when coiling and uncoiling.
