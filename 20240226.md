## G-code sender

I think I've changed my mind about switching to Gtk4. I'm going to persist with Gio. It is less work
to make Gio act how I want than to switch to Gtk4, and it's not even obvious that Gtk4 will be easier
even after I switch, it's a much bigger best to tame.

The main concrete gripe that I had was that I had no sensible way to make a toolbar that would wrap to
the next row when it overflows, but that ended up being less than 70 lines: https://github.com/jes/pugsender/blob/140242a581bfd3077cd4d037612d389498726e2a/toolbar.go

So I'm sticking with Gio for now, and I spent most of the morning tidying up various TODO items.
