## OpenSIPS

Submitted this PR: https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/pull/3255

## SCAMP

Implemented `grshift`/`grunshift`: https://github.com/jes/scamp-cpu/commit/a180c4a61f3523cfc6bb93b52c9ed7602ec87a3c

 * add some automated testing
 * install new filesystem on real computer

So the plan for the automated testing is that I'll type `make test`, and it will build a test program
using `compiler/slangc`, make a new `os.disk` using
`kernel/Makefile`, it will then use `fs/fs` to replace `/bin/init` with a test program, and it will use
`emulator/scamp` to run the test program, and then diff its output against the desired output.

I've made a start on this under `test/`.

## Garage

I put a powerline ethernet adapter next to the PC, but it didn't get any signal. I found that it gets signal in
some of the garage sockets, but drops off as it gets further from the house. I've put it in the last socket
that gets a good signal, and then ran a long ethernet cable to the PC, and that seems to be satisfactory.

 * pin the cable up
 * put the shelves up
 * put a MDF top on the island bench
 * put a MDF top on the computer desk
 * organise the mess that is all over the floor

Most of my short-ish pieces of metal are now stored in the rack: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5047

I have made good progress in organising the mess from the floor, but not done the MDF or shelves yet.
I want the place tidier first.

Next up I have cleaning products, lubricants, glues, finishes to organise: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5048

## Stepper motor clocks

I'm making a start on 3d printing the parts for the clocks. For each clock, I need:

 * 4x bearing-block.stl
 * 4x collar.stl
 * 2x dialfoot.stl
 * geneva-drive-wheel.stl
 * firstwheel.stl
 * secondwheel.stl
 * secondwheel-pinion.stl
 * thirdwheel.stl
 * hourwheel.stl
 * hourcounterwheel.stl
 * secondwheel-spacer.stl
 * thirdwheel-spacer.stl
 * counterwheel-spacer.stl
 * electrical-cover.stl
 * hour-hand.stl
 * minute-hand.stl

For the white parts is 2 print jobs, totalling 6 hours printing time and 150g of filament. That is if
I try to print the electrical cover with no support material. Not clear how well that will work.

Then there is obviously a separate job required in black filament for the hands.

And perhaps tomorrow I can surface off the CNC router table, flatten the boards, and make the wooden parts.

Update: printing the electrical cover with no support didn't work. I'm leaving the job running for now because I
think the 3 gears might come out successfully, but I'll have to print the electrical cover on its own.

Update: I've stopped it because it was making too much of a mess. I should have stopped it earlier.

I reprinted just the gears. I now have all the 3d-printed parts required for 1 clock except for the hands and the electrical 
cover.
