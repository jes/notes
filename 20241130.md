## Remontoire

So the plan today is to make a first attempt at a Korfhage-style remontoire.

See http://www.my-time-machines.net/korfhage_remontore.htm

But I'll put it directly on the shaft with the escape wheel, instead of on a
shaft that is then geared to the escape wheel, because I don't see the use in having
the extra stage of gear meshing in between.

So I need to "split" my escape wheel shaft between the pinion and the escape wheel,
and put the bevel gears in between, and also have another shaft
geared off the pinion side, spinning faster, to catch the arm on the remontoire.

If I want it to wind up every quarter of a turn, and the arm will catch the remontoire
after a quarter of a turn, then the arm needs to spin 4x as fast.

The first question is how do you make bevel gears in FreeCAD?
One possibility would be to make 2 PartDesign InvoluteGear profiles, shift one up
by a few mm, and make the upper one have smaller modulus, and loft between them?

Another possibility is to use the Gears workbench, but I tried to install it and it hasn't
worked.

Another possibility is to pad up a PartDesign InvoluteGear with a draft angle.

I think the taper angle thing is not right. I don't want a flat gear that gets narrower
as it goes upwards, I want it to stay the same size, but project on a line that goes at
22.5 degrees.

So maybe I try that? Make an InvoluteGear, pad it, then make a datum line from
the root of one of the teeth, upwards at 22.5 degrees from vertical, leaning towards the origin.
Then draw the profile of the tooth, pocket it along the datum line, PolarPattern around
Z?

No, the tooth profile will be skewed.

OK, so I do the same thing, but start with a flat disc instead of a padded InvoluteGear,
and to reference the tooth shape I make a flat InvoluteGear and tilt it by 22.5 degrees.

Scratch all that. I uninstalled and reinstalled the Gears workbench and it is working,
so I'll use that.

Actually, update: let's make it rewind every eighth of a turn instead of every quarter.

cos(45 deg.) = 0.71, cos(22.5 deg.) = 0.92

If it rewinds a quarter of a turn at a time (from -45 deg. to +45 deg.),
the torque will vary by a lot more than if it only rewinds an eighth at a time.

It might be a better idea to make it rewind by some proportion that doesn't evenly divide
the circle, by the "hunting tooth" principle.

OK, I have this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5808

So the weight will hang off the existing ratcheting drum, and turn the existing big gear
that is on the same shaft. That then turns the existing roller lantern pinion, which
previously was connected directly to the escape wheel shaft.

The roller lantern pinion turns its shaft, which turns the first bevel gear, which both raises
up the middle bevel gear, and turns the adjacent shaft 8x as fast. So after an eighth of a
turn, the arm on the adjacent shaft hits the protrusion from the middle bevel
gear, which stops it from going any further.

The middle bevel gear is trying to fall down under its weight, which makes the final bevel
gear turn, which turns the escape wheel. Once the escape wheel has done an eighth of a turn,
the middle bevel gear will have fallen far enough for the arm to unlock, which allows the
drive weight to start falling again, until the adjacent shaft has done another complete turn
and the arm is again locked against the protrusion of the middle bevel gear, etc. until
you run out of string.

I have the drive weight and the adjacent shaft on the same centre line so that I can use
the same physical shaft for both of them, and just let the adjacent gear spin freely
on the shaft, to simplify the frame.

So now I just need a frame to hold it all, and maybe something to allow me to attach weights to
the middle bevel gear's shaft.

Not very elegant, but it might do for now. I really need to build a metal frame, but I
think I prefer the flexibility of bolting 3d-printed parts together for now.

I'm just going to print all of these parts and see how I get on.

It'll be 2 print jobs of 2 hours each. I'm going to have a break now during the first
print job, and capture a "control" trace during the second one. Then fit the remontoire
and see if it works & what difference it makes.
