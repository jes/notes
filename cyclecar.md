# Cyclecar

## Engine

ZS190, supposedly 16hp.

## Exhaust

 * ??? probably have to make your own

## Wheels

I have some 17x1.6" wheels that look to be front wheels from a motorbike, they have one side open where a drum brake assembly could fit and the other side blank.

## Tyres

Bot says the biggest tyre you can put on a 17x1.6" wheel is 3.00-17, and for example a Kenda K272 looks good and is about £45 per tyre.

## Fuel tank

 * You can get these plastic fuel oil tanks on eBay that you drill for your own tap

## Leaf springs

I've ordered front leaf springs for a "Club Car" golf cart. They have 2 leaves but I will remove one.

## Front hubs

 * ???

## Rear hubs

 * I'm thinking taper-lock fittings.

## Lights

 * ??? Presumed readily available

## Brakes

Check this out: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/204669651717

Looks to have:

 * discs, pads, calipers, master cylinder
 * carriers for floating calipers
 * master cylinder drives 2 independent circuits (front and rear)
 * provision for cable-operated handbrake on rear caliper
 * pressure-activated brake light switch

I've ordered one.

## Reversing

I've ordered a "universal go-kart reversing gearbox". It is sold as being suitable for up to 13hp, but a unit that looks equivalent is sold elsewhere for up to only 7hp, so unclear how well this will hold up. I
guess we'll find out.

Teardown begins at 10:30 in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr9sfgW3vsg

I think the ratio is 1.25:1 in forwards mode.

### GY6

Another option is a "GY6" reversing gearbox.

GY6 reversing mechanism disassembly is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALu3WWRsG18 - happily, nothing inside is spinning while it's in forwards gear, I think this will be adequate provided it can be mated to either the ZS190 gearbox output or the axle.

This guy puts it on a 50hp engine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4c4AuKVVJw - he has a follow-up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJmb9dp08mQ where something did fail, but it was nothing to do with the reversing gearbox, that's encouraging.
And a teardown in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0RRHEuYprw in which nothing appears damaged.

Note the GY6 reversing gearbox has a reduced ratio in reverse, so it matters which way you drive it!

The GY6 gearbox may be able to handle more power. One guy was having the "universal go-kart" one keep skipping teeth, although I don't quite understand why, it's possible his issue was with some other part of his drivetrain.

## Chassis

 * good Austin 7 chassis info in this vid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTUkgRdteA4 - in particular the layout of brakes, steering, and suspension
