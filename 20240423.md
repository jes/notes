## Machine building

Well I made a template, assembled it with threaded inserts, and checked that it fits:

That is... a lot worse than I expected. It looks like it is the holes that are drilled
in the baseplate in the wrong place, rather than the template or the upright being wrong.

So indeed I should have used a drilling template. I'm not really sure how this happened.

Measuring the outer holes, they are 144mm apart, should be 140mm.

It looks like it'll fit in the other side of the baseplate though, so I'll fit that one
and think about what to do. Probably the solution is to make the holes a lot bigger and mix
in some epoxy & "Minerva powder" to take up the gap.

Gluing now:

It's 10am now, so I think at about 1pm I want to come and take the bolts & template off, and
hopefully it won't have set too hard by that point.
