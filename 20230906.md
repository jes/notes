I was at Ruari's today working on his CNC machine so haven't done any work on the watch project.
We made a spoilboard, fixed a rattling panel, and fixed the Z-axis motor coupling.

## Watch stuff

I should 3d print a fusee for the escapement prototype, so that I can see how it really performs
under varying torque.

I also need to work out how much my actual torque is going to vary over the life of the spring.
Considering that friction losses will be broadly constant (maybe?), the torque remaining by the
time the drive reaches the escape wheel will have dropped by a higher proportion than that
at the mainspring. So if the watch is going to work without a fusee, the change in torque at the
output of the mainspring needs to be considerably *less* than the change that would be required to throw it off
by 1%.

Apart from that, I'm going to spend half an hour playing with the escapement simulator to try and find a more
stable system. It would be good to have a way to plot the amount of energy lost to friction losses.

From watching the video, it actually performs much better in real life than in the simulation. The simulation
shows it hesitating as the receiving pallet slides too far up the face of the tooth, but this doesn't happen
in real life. Why? I think because the amplitude is lower. With higher amplitude it can almost "over-centre"
against the tooth, and then the pressure from the tooth is too close to the radial of the anchor. It seems
to run more smoothly in the sim if I much about with the mass, torque, and spring stiffness to reduce the amplitude.

Came up with this interesting configuration: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4611 - very asymmetrical
but quite reliable as it always has the teeth pushing the pallets in a useful direction (albeit with
different leverage for one pallet vs the other)

And this version with only 3 escape wheel teeth: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4612

Next stuff to work on:

* fusee for the escapement prototype
* life-size prototype of barrel, to measure torque output with various springs
* 3d printed prototypes of the weird asymmetrical designs (try to make them compatible with the fusee)

Ideas for sources of springs suitable for the mainspring:

* scrap watch/clock movements
* ???
