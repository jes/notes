## Garage

I've put all the decking planks up on the wall, and some of the longer other planks, and
put the other bits of wood storage nearby: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5051

I've put a big shelf up above the workbench: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5052

And sorted out the cans, sandpaper, etc.: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5053

I'm slightly concerned that the "data" light isn't showing on the powerline ethernet
adapter, is it only within range intermittently? I may need to move it.
