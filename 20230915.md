## Levers

I've been thinking a bit more about putting a "lever" on the escapement. I think I'd like
to see some sort of prototype of it. Whatever is easiest out of 3d-printed or simulation.

I'm also keen to try and have a harder look at the Roskopf escapement.

Jacques Favre has this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS52AALli2U

It looks like it is not the same as the simple lever idea I want to try, it has all the complex interactions
of locking, banking pins, guard pin, etc.

"In the original watch the pins are 0.2mm in diameter" - good fact.

The difference between the English lever and the Swiss lever is whether the lever pivot is inline
with the escape and balance wheel (Swiss) or whether it is at 90 degrees (English): http://horology-student.org/themes/types-of-escapements/#english

## Workholding

For making a lot of the parts, I'm going to want to start on the lathe and then move to the router table, so I will need
a way to hold the superglue arbor vertical. I have 2 ideas:

 * a mini v-block that I can bolt to the table
 * an adapter to bolt chucks to the table

Or maybe just get long enough bolts to hold a chuck down with strap clamps?? Let's go with that for now. Especially the collet chuck won't
need super long bolts, will just need a spacer to make the mounting studs clear the table.

## Balance wheel machining

Let's try out the process of starting on the lathe, just to practice, so I'll want to:

* get a piece of aluminium or brass >3mm thick, >26 mm diameter (do I even have such a piece? maybe need to make it out of plate)
* fit it to the superglue arbor
* turn to 3mm thickness, 26mm diameter
* bore 2mm hole
* transfer to router table for crossing-out & pin-hole boring

Well, that didn't go to plan. Given that I was going to have to make a disc out of 3mm plate anyway, I couldn't
be bothered transferring it to the lathe and back, so I just machined the whole thing on the router.

It went fine except the lead-in/out gouged the work, idiotic mistake, should have noticed that in FreeCAD: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4627

Next up: make some 1mm pallet pins!

## Notes system

I think I want a way to publish these notes that makes them easier to read (and share?) than the github view.
Some sort of cron that pulls the github repo and rebuilds a static-site if anything has changed.

There are 2 types of file:
 * daily notes
 * topic notes

They can be identified because daily notes are yyyymmdd.md and topic notes are not.

Sometimes I paste imagebin links in the text, I probably want these expanded to show the actual image, but otherwise
just markdown-to-html, a chronological index page, and some sort of index of topic pages (maybe just a navbar for now,
until there are too many? in future could make it hierarchical).

I wrote a static site generator similar to the one for the blog. It could maybe do with a search function (and for that matter,
maybe the blog could too). I don't know whether the best way is to generate an index in a javascript file which is loaded on-demand,
or maybe a bunch of indexes named by the first few characters of the search term, or maybe just link to a DuckDuckGo search.

## Ceiling

Need to order supplies to build the ceiling. I'm debating whether to construct a wooden frame, which is faff and expense but will
simplify the fitting of the plasterboard, or whether to attach the plasterboard directly to the aluminium, which will be much more annoying
than attaching it to wood.

I think just attach the plasterboard to the aluminium, get Emma to help, and use technique to make it easy. It would probably be easier
to fit a larger number of smaller sheets instead of a small number of full-size sheets. Maybe just cut them into quarters once they
arrive, if we find fitting full sheets too difficult.

Need to buy:

* 6x full sheets of plasterboard for main conservatory ceiling
* 1x full sheet OSB for the alleyway
* screws to attach boards to aluminium
