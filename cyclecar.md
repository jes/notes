Engine:

 * ZS190 is about £900 and 20hp
 * https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/365949490285 "GY6 200cc with Reverse Gear", £500, but supposedly only 9.1hp

Exhaust:

 * ??? probably have to make your own

Wheels:

 * Royal Enfield Classic 350 front wheel is 19", spoked, and about £100 each
 * 21" motocross front wheels are probably a better choice, e.g. KX125, but then you have to find tyres
 * Pembleton Brooklands self-builds generally use 19" wheels
 * The John Haynes Austin 7 Special uses 19" wheels

Fuel tank:

 * You can get these plastic fuel oil tanks on eBay that you drill for your own tap

Leaf springs:

 * Cyclekart Workshop has leaf springs available for both half-elliptic and quarter-elliptic configuration, and probably approximately the required stiffness, https://cyclekartworkshop.co.uk/products/

Lights:

 * ??? Presumed readily available

Brakes:

 * ??? Probably motocross brakes to suit discs mounted on the wheels

Reversing:

 * ??? Options are skip it, add a reversing gearbox, or use electric motor
 * See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__HUgo_tAzc
 * there is a "universal reversing gearbox" for go-karts, but specifies it's good for up to 13hp - teardown begins at 10:30 in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr9sfgW3vsg
 * also possible to buy a "GY6" reversing gearbox independently of the engine, unclear how much power it is good for, however looks to be possible to do a straight swap for a plain sprocket in the event that the gearbox fails, so could be a good choice - other than that the spline does not match a ZS190

GY6 reversing mechanism disassembly is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALu3WWRsG18 - happily, nothing inside is spinning while it's in forwards gear, I think this will be adequate provided it can be mated to either the ZS190 gearbox output or the axle.

This guy puts it on a 50hp engine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4c4AuKVVJw - he has a follow-up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJmb9dp08mQ where something did fail, but it was nothing to do with the reversing gearbox, that's encouraging.
And a teardown in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0RRHEuYprw in which nothing appears damaged.

Note the GY6 reversing gearbox has a reduced ratio in reverse, so it matters which way you drive it!

To be honest I think either the GY6 style or the "universal go-kart" style would be fine, both look perfectly substantial from what I can see in the disassembly videos.

Chassis:

 * good Austin 7 chassis info in this vid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTUkgRdteA4 - in particular the layout of brakes, steering, and suspension
