The plan today is to make the escape wheel bigger, with more teeth and less space between
the teeth, and corresponding smaller pallets.

Working in `escapement2.FCStd`.

Currently the wheel diameter is 180mm and has 37 teeth. Circumference is 565.5mm,
so tooth pitch is 15.3mm. If we reduce that to 14mm pitch, and increase wheel diameter to
230mm, we get about 51 teeth.

I couldn't make it work with 51 teeth, went with 47.

The escaping angle now needs to be at least +/- **54 deg.** to ensure the opposing
tooth lands on the resting surface instead of the impulse surface.

Oops, I think this isn't going to work. We can't add 50mm to the escape wheel
diameter without adding 50mm to the separation between the pallets, and I think
basically all of the length of the balance shaft is already used up.

Past the pivots the shaft is 290mm long. The light gate is 25mm tall, leaving 265mm.

Then the balance wheel is 10mm tall without a clamp, the clamp for the spring is 5mm,
so we have 250mm of balance shaft at most, which only allows for only 20mm of spring,
which is not enough. So the spring will have to get stiffer, or the shaft will have to
get longer.

For now I'll just put the old escape wheel back on but use the new slightly-smaller pallets.
