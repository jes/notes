## Clock

I'm going to put the remontoire driving side on with just 1 bearing, just to see if it
will work. I'm not 100% sure there is enough room. If it works then I can think about making
an alternative bearing block with 2 bearings in it.

It looks to be almost working. I'm driving it by applying pressure to the remontoire driving
side with my finger.

Issues are:

 * the balance pivots are only located by the thread, so every time you adjust them vertically, they also move around horizontally
 * the remontoire weight has to be shorter than before to fit inside the frame, so it isn't heavy enough now
 * the remontoire driving side bearing is too wobbly
 * the remontoire catching arm seems to get caught at the wrong position, not sure why

Solutions:

 * maybe redesign the balance pivots so there is a cylindrical feature for locating horizontally, and the thread only moves up/down?
 * make the remontoire weight heavier
 * make a proper bearing for the remontoire driving side
 * have a look in CAD and work out why the remontoire arm angle is wrong

Forget the balance pivots for now, revisit that later.

I used the old winding drum as a remontoire weight, and it now looks like it runs! But
amplitude only about 145 degrees.

So next thing is CAD for the bearing. Ideally it would reach over the roller lantern pinion
in a U-shape to support the shaft closer to the middle. Not sure if I have enough room
for that:

I think just make a slightly shorter version of the double-ended bearing that supports
the escape wheel. And maybe come back to it in the future and make everything a bit
more delicate.

Seems to be working OK! And feels much more legit than expected. Amplitude is about 160 degrees now.

So next up is putting the winding drum on and actually letting the clock run.
