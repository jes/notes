## Deadbeat spring escapement

The new anchor didn't help. Same as the old one, it loses energy with every oscillation.

So we're saying there is too much energy lost in:

 * balance wheel pivot
 * balance spring not being a real spring
 * anchor pivot
 * friction on anchor surfaces

A normal anniversary clock has the balance wheel suspended by the spring, so there is no friction in the pivots. And the spring
is a real spring, so it doesn't lose so much energy when coiling and uncoiling.

## CNC machine

I'm going to make a start on the aluminium surface. It needs:

 * counterbores on mounting holes
 * surface the top
 * grid of M6 threaded holes
 * 3d print some flexible plugs for the bolt holes & threaded holes?

I'm thinking I do the counterbores one-by-one with a FreeCAD Path Helix job that will just do one
counterbore at X0Y0, and then jog to the location of each hole. Then I surface the top with
either FaceMill or PocketShape, and then think about how to do the drilling, then take the aluminium plate
off, tap the threads, and put it back on?

First helix worked, but was a bit "crunchy", I think perhaps it needs to be climb milling and it is
doing conventional? I'll reverse that for the next one.

Seems maybe slightly better, not sure.

All 5 mounting holes counterbored and bolted down properly now, good.

Now do I surface the top with the single-flute 6mm tool or try out the fly cutter?

I think maybe try the fly cutter another time, stick to the 6mm tool for this because I know
it will work.

I did quite a few passes because it kept leaving small ridges, I think the spindle tram could do with
improvement after all. In the end I did 1.5mm steps, at 10000 rpm and 3000 mm/min, seems OK for now.
