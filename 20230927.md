I was at Ruari's doing CNC work again today.

## Meshmill bugs

We ran some Meshmill rotary G-code for the first time. It mostly worked!

Bugs discovered:

1. If you save and re-open a "rotary" project, it forgets the "rotary" setting.

2. If you have a path generated, and then you click "Generate toolpath", and then "Stop" it,
and then "Save G-code", you get an empty file. It should either give you the file for the
previous toolpath, or disable the "Save G-code" button.

3. Feed rate calculation is wrong because it only measures distance in 3D space but some
moves are around very long arc (fixed on the laptop).

4. It doesn't do roughing for rotary paths because Z is always greater than 0 (fixed on the laptop).

5. The part is not quite aligned with 0 degrees, seems off by a bit, not sure why.

6. The part has a "step" at about the mid-point, not sure why.

Todo:

 * check the "BUGS" file on the laptop in case there are any I forgot
 * commit the fixes
