## Van der Pol oscillator

I remember reading in "Harrison Decoded" that the Burgess Clock B is a non-linear or "Van der
Pol" oscillator. Which I think means it doesn't stabilise at a single point in
period/amplitude space, but instead stabilises in a *ring*.

More on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator

Could that be the reason for the hunting amplitude problem? Maybe it's not a problem at all,
it's just the nature of the thing?

Actually I think this is wrong. The "ring" is in position/velocity space, not period/amplitude
space.

But, for that matter, I could add a position/velocity plot and see what it looks like!

This might look smoother if we applied the quadratic interpolation to the position data.

And would be good to see what it looks like while the amplitude is ramping up/down,
I think we'd expect to see several laps closing in on the steady state loop.

And I think maybe the pointy ends is because of the thing where the values are basically
offset sideways by 2 degrees when the balance wheel is swinging in the reverse direction.

I'll try to fix that and see if it looks smoother. That might also explain the lumpiness
in the velocity & acceleration plots. Meh, doesn't seem to help.

Ramping up looks like this:

Lots of laps, converging on the stable state.

## Shorter resting surface

Next up is solving the problem with the back corner of the inactive pallet's
resting surface contacting the escape wheel at large amplitudes.

I've increased the angle of the gap from 90 deg. to 140 deg., in CAD this looks
like it allows for about +/- 170 deg. rotation, or 340 deg. total amplitude.

Broadly the same as before, but at least now it can go to higher ampltiudes without hitting
the wheel.

## Variable resting radius

So now to take out the amplitude coefficient, I want to try making the resting surface
not concentric with the shaft.

If the balance wheel ticks faster in the long arcs then I need to slow it down in the long
arcs, which means I need to make the escape wheel push it further and slow its
return, so I think the radius needs to decrease as amplitude increases, like on H4.

I'll start by making the radius change as extreme as I can manage, hopefully that will
invert the amplitude-period relationship, and then we can go somewhere in between to
make it isochronous??

It starts out with a constant radius for the first ~40 degrees of the resting
surface, then slowly decreases from 4.5mm radius to 3mm radius. So that means the effect
only applies for amplitudes greater than about 170 degrees, which I think should be fine.

This skips teeth if the amplitude is too high, because 0.45mm from
the balance shaft is not enough to prevent the escape wheel from slipping past.

Fortunately it seems to run at a lower amplitude than before, so in a stable state it is not
skipping teeth.

So I think that looks like an improvement! After the initial ramp it stayed within
about 1.25ms. It looks like we could do with a more extreme version of the same
effect though, because it still looks like period goes down as amplitude goes up.

## Temperature and pressure monitoring

I'm going to get a Raspberry Pi hooked up to this BMP180 and see how to read data off it.

I have:

 * Pi Zero W v1.1
 * "Raspberry Pi (c) 2011,12" (is this an original Raspberry Pi?)
 * Pi 3 Model B v1.2
 * Pi 4 Model B

The Pi 3 has heatsinks on it, the Pi 4 does not.

The original Pi has no WiFi but mine has a USB wifi dongle in it. I'll just go with the Pi 4.

There's an `rpi-imager` in apt, apparently this is the best way to install Raspbian now.

Quite good, it lets you easily configured username, password, SSH keys, and WiFi.

It took 15 minutes to write the image to the microSD card, which is unmarked. Is this a bad
microSD card or is that normal?

To find the Pi:

    sudo nmap -p 22 --open -sV 192.168.1.0/24

Hmm, can't find it.

The power light is going out a few seconds after plugging it in.

Switched to a different power supply, now the light is staying on but still can't find it
with nmap.

I put the microSD card back in the PC and the root partition won't mount, I think the microSD
card is just bad. I only have one other spare, and I have written "bad?" on it in pen.
It is labelled as SanDisk but I think it is a fake.
I'll try that one.

This time it only took 8 minutes to write the image.

And now I've found it on the network with nmap!

Looking at https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/raspberry-pi-and-i2c-air-pressure-sensor-bmp180/

I used `raspi-config` to enable the I2C bus, and then `i2cdetect -y 1` scans the bus. Now
I need to wire it up. I'm using female-to-female jumper cables.

Great success, `i2cdetect` found it on the first try.

And then the example code is in https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code

Lol, no it isn't. Deprecated, classic.

Replaced with a "Blinka" Python library that you're meant to install with pip, except of
course pip doesn't want to do it because of "system-managed python libraries", and apt
doesn't have the library.

There is example code on https://www.pibits.net/code/raspberry-pi-bmp180-sensor.php but it
is for Python2 instead of Python3.

OK, porting it to Python3 was easy, and now it is working:

    jes@raspberrypi:~/bmp180 $ ./bmp180.py 
    Altitude : 29.23 m
    Pressure : 1009.74 hPa 
    Temperature in Celsius : 23.83 C
    Temperature in Fahrenheit : 74.89 F

That temperature seems a bit on the warm side, it is not really that warm here. Maybe just
the electroncis are warm.

I have a loop running in `screen` logging temperature and pressure to a CSV, so that I can
potentially compare it with recorded clock data in the future.

## SHT85

The SHT85 has arrived and it is absolutely tiny. Probably I will solder wires directly
to the pins and put a 3d-printed holder on it.

I found this pic online describing the pinout:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5803

And the eBay listing I bought says "Supply voltage range from 2.15 to 5.5V", so it is
fine with either 3.3v or 5v.

## Amplitude vs Period

I think there is a bit of an error in here!

If we don't have an equal number of period samples and amplitude samples (e.g. we get the odd
spurious amplitude sample), then the x/y coordinates end up not actually lining up
properly.

So you get the most recent period sample plotted against an amplitude sample 10 steps behind.

I need to make it add a sample for the most recent period and the most recent amplitude,
every time either one of them changes.

One good part is this means we get twice as many points on the amplitude-period chart, because
we get 4 per cycle: 2 each for the amplitude peaks, and 2 each for the zero-crossings.

Means I now need to average over 142 data points for the period-amplitude chart, but only
74 for the period and amplitude ones individually. Hmm. I've made it just double the window
size in the averaging code, that'll do.

Actually this is still no good. If we are getting spurious amplitude values then the averaging
window will no longer line up with the escape wheel rotation.

So maybe I just keep track of what was the maximum balance wheel extent, and only update
the amplitude and period data at the zero crossings?

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5801

Looks like the period/amplitude plot is much closer to following repeated tracks now,
instead of drifting over time. So that should be a good improvement. But all of my previous
averaged period/amplitude plots are somewhat suspect.

## TODO

 * more gearing stages
 * adjustable gear depthing
 * fine adjust on escapement depthing
 * fine adjust on balance pivot alignment
 * stiffer frame
 * temperature and pressure monitoring
 * try cutting the pallets directly into the balance shaft
 * more balance weights
 * apply tare on server-side so that it persists
