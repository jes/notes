## Stepper motor clocks

I replaced the 12v transformer with a 6.3v one, hopefully it cures the buzzing issue.

## 1x escapement

I've made the slot bigger to try and stop it rubbing: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5094

And I'm going to 3d print it. I'm wondering if I should increase the flow rate or something to make
the prints with the 0.25mm nozzle a bit stronger.

The larger slot was a small help, but I discovered the real problem: the impulse pin was
leaning to one side. I've straightened it up and the balance wheel can now swing back
and forth freely, pushing the lever as it crosses the centre point. Great success,
does it tick now, or is there more?

Yes, it ticks a bit when powered by hand, but keeps stopping. I'm going to make a little hook on the string
and power it with some nuts.

It's very close but not quite working. The interaction of the escape wheel and pallet pins may be not quite
right.

(Both the escape wheel and the balance wheel are trying to move clockwise at this point).

The movement is locked up because the discharging pallet pin has not banked all the way into the root
of the tooth, so when the receiving pallet pin tries to move back down it is blocked by a tooth.

The balance wheel is unable to move clockwise, because the impulse pin can't move the lever, because
the receiving pallet pin is stuck. But why didn't the escape wheel move round further? "Lack of torque"
is one explanation, but here I have an M20 nut on the end of the string, which should be more than
adequate.

I think the issue is that both pallet pins are in contact with the escape wheel at the same time.
The escape wheel is prevented from moving by the receiving pallet pin, which can't move up because the discharging pallet
pin is already banked against the wheel.

But why? I think the pins are not perpendicular enough and the escape wheel is not printed with sufficient quality.
Maybe the escape wheel is also not concentric to its shaft.

But we are making progress (slowly). The balance wheel is good now, and the impulse pin can move the it back and forth
via the slot. But the impulse pin still rubs on the top of the slot, and the pallets & escape wheel don't work.

That the impulse pin rubs on the slot *and* the lever doesn't always move far enough to let the escape wheel turn could
both be caused by the same issue. Namely the escape wheel is too poor, or is not concentric enough. So maybe I try to
take the escape wheel off the metal escapement and fit it in here.

Yep: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5096

And this is *so* close to working. With an M20 nut I have observed it tick for nearly 50 consecutive cycles
(100 ticks). OK, they weren't particularly convincing ticks, but they were ticks.

I think there is definitely still some concentricity error in the escape wheel because the "impulse pin
rubbing in slot" condition occurs intermittently, presumed in sync with the rotation of the escape wheel.

And obviously it needs to run with significantly less weight than the M20 nut, but even this would be a good start.

I tried to record a video and it worked even better than the first time:
