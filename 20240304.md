## Machine design

Todo:

 * ballnut holders
 * cut-outs for clearance
 * hole locations
 * work out what sort of threaded inserts I want
 * threaded insert locations
 * loose-end bearing blocks
 * motor mounts
 * check that it actually does fit in the tub!

I found that I don't have enough space for the ballnut holders,
assuming they are all the same size as the one I measured. I may
need to make the ballscrews longer, good job I haven't cut them
down yet...
