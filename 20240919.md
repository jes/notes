## Unproven hypotheses

From the last point on https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/thc4RemfLcM5AdJDa/skills-from-a-year-of-purposeful-rationality-practice I thought
it might be a good idea to write down 3 of my hypotheses, to focus the mind.

So here are 3 of my unproven hypotheses:

1. Putting a stiffer spring on the anniversary clock mechanism will allow me to increase the spring length, balance moment of inertia, and drive torque, with the result being a mechanism that ticks slower and has larger amplitude than the current one.
2. The persistent beat error is caused by an inability to accurately align the fork, and will go away if I make it easier to rotate the suspension spring on its mount.
3. Once the escapement is solved I can just *build the rest of the clock* and there won't be any further difficulties.
