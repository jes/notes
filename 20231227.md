## Planar verge escapement

What about having 2 escape wheels geared together to turn in opposite directions at the same speed,
and both pressing against a shared "flag" on the balance shaft?

Like this:

Obviously make the flag shorter and move the balance shaft closer than in that diagram.

That might work just like a normal verge escapement, including allowing amplitudes up to almost 90 degrees?

So an improvement compared to my previous "planar verge" escapement, and also probably less sliding friction.
