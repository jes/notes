## Custom milling cutters

I'm going to try to make a custom 1mm end mill, just to see if it works, or how well it works.

The smallest collet for the router is 3mm, so I'll use 3mm silver steel, taper it down to a 1mm
straight section, and then machine half the straight section away.

Do I also need to provide some clearance to stop the back of the tool from rubbing? I think skip
that for now, but I did consider that I could turn the cutting section slightly eccentric to the
shank, and then machine it in half so that the cutting tip is at the largest radius, which
gets you some back clearance for free.

I have this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5251

It is about 1.2mm diameter. Needs some tidying up, then hardening.

Having the collet chuck on the CNC router is *very* handy, but it is not clamped down hard enough so
it shifts every time I tighten/loosen it. Might be worth making some sort of fixture plate for accurate
positioning. Bonus points if the chuck can be removed without moving the location of the register, so
that it can be put back in almost exactly the same place.

Machining the flat on the cutter has left slightly rounded edges. Maybe I should have taken some spring passes?

Let's try and cut some brass with it!

Great success?

It raised a bit of a burr, and it made some unhappy noises, but it seems to have worked. All at 0.1mm depth of cut,
with several passes. The "vertical" cut
was 24000 rpm and 100 mm/min, the "horizontal" one was 9000 rpm and 60 mm/min. Doesn't seem to have made a lot of difference.
The cutter does not seem substantially worn.

I think I should do most of my machining with "proper" cutters, but I can almost certainly make small custom cutters to
get into tight corners.

I'm going to try to sharpen it and try again, see if I can stop it from raising a burr.

I sharpened it by rubbing it against the "fine whetstone", which is so soft that it gets rubbed away.

Doesn't seem to have made a lot of difference, possibly it's a bit worse, but possibly that is because I was a bit more
aggressive with the cut.

So what can we conclude?

It is very easy to make your own tiny D-bit cutters, and they do work, but not spectacularly well?

## Thin barrel

Could I machine down the new thin barrel (& hub) to accept the 0.35mm piano wire? Would
that work better?

## Duplex escapement

I'd like to do the CAD for a 1x-scale metal duplex escapement.

I'll also want to make the collet chuck square to the spindle as I know it is currently not. And maybe
look at tramming the spindle to the axes.

Ah, but first I need to finish `duplex-escapement2-smallroller.FCStd` and see if it looks sensible. Then decide whether
I'm using the "smallroller" version or not in my metal model.

 * escape wheel teeth: **8**
 * unlocking angle: **24 degrees** of roller (-10 degrees)
 * impulse angle: **52.5 degrees** of roller (+6.5 degrees)
 * unlocking: **8 degrees** of escape wheel (-3 degrees)
 * impulse drop: **2.5 degrees** of escape wheel (=)
 * impulsing: **34 degrees** of escape wheel (+5.5 degrees)
 * lock drop: **2.5 degrees** of escape wheel (-0.5 degrees)

So we're now spending `34 / 45 = ~75%` of escape wheel motion
on impulse, which is an improvement on before. And we're getting
more roller motion spent on impulse and less on unlocking,
which I think is good. So I think this is an improvement.

We do reduce the engagement of the locking tooth with the roller,
which means it potentially requires better accuracy.

I think try to build this "smallroller" version, because it looks
like an improvement. If it becomes apparent that it requires
too much accuracy, then either get better or change the design
accordingly.

I've made a start on the CAD in `metal-model.FCStd`.

Suggested order of operations for making it:

 * make the mainplace & balance cock including adjustable cone pivot
 * make the balance wheel & balance shaft (with roller table left as blank)
 * set up the balance wheel, with a hairspring, measure
   its period, check that it swings freely
 * machine the roller onto the balance shaft
 * make the escape wheel & shaft & the bridge
 * try to turn the escape wheel **gently** by hand and see if it
   looks like it might work
 * make the barrel output gear
 * put some flats on the barrel shaft to engage the gear
 * hold the barrel wound by hand and see if it drives the escapement
 * cross-drill the barrel shaft for a retaining pin
 * machine ratchet teeth on the barrel
 * make click and clickspring

## Metal duplex escapement parts

Mostly, all parts should be approximately the shape and size that
they would be in the finished watch. I am happy to make exceptions
for height, to increase clearances, because it makes it easier to
put together.

### Balance wheel

Thinner than the last one, because the thickness of the balance wheel directly contributes to the thickness
of the watch.

### Balance shaft

Holds balance wheel, roller, hairspring collet

### Roller

Has locking surface and impulse pallet, needs to be machinable in a single 3-axis setup.

Plan to machine this directly onto the balance shaft.

### Escape wheel

Has locking teeth and impulse teeth.

### Escape wheel shaft

Needs to hold escape wheel and escape wheel pinion.

### Escape wheel pinion

8 leaf, module 0.3?

### Mainspring barrel

Use the existing mainspring barrel, but cut some ratcheting teeth into the outside of it.

How is the mainspring barrel constrained axially? Probably we
use a retaining nut or a cross-pin or something to keep the output
gear in place.

### Mainspring gear

Module 0.3, 73 teeth? (According to `thin-barrel-direct-drive.FCStd`)

### Mainplate

Needs pivot holes for mainspring barrel, escape wheel, balance wheel.

Also needs to hold the clickspring/click & the hairspring.

### Balance cock

Spring-loaded threaded hole for adjustment of cone pivot.

### Adjustable balance pivot

A (M3? smaller?) grub screw with female cone. Probably drilled 0.3mm so there
is definitely clearance at the point of the cone.

### Bridge

Hold the escape wheel and mainspring.

### Clickspring & click

The spring can be some 0.35mm piano wire. The click can be brass or steel.
