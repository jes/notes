## Jacot Duplex escapement

Found this on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59rCIruI2cc

It has 2 locking teeth, close together, for every impulse tooth. The advantage (for me) being that the escape wheel
turns more slowly and therefore less gearing is required of the train. The disadvantage is obviously that you waste more
energy on frictional rest (but if you can lose a wheel in the train, maybe you get that back anyway?).

But let's try and lay out a normal duplex escapement first.

## Thin barrel

It took me several tries to assemble the thin barrel with the loop of the spring actually catching
in the hook. Eventually I realised that I had cut the end of the wire in the wrong axis so the sharp
point was driving the hook apart and letting the wire slip out. I re-cut the end of the wire perpendicular,
so that the sharp point will catch on the hook, and this worked a bit better, but by this time the hook
was too fatigued from being bent and it broke off:

But also, the slot in the hub was much larger than it needed to be. I could do the same thing again but
make the slot smaller (so that it is stronger) and I bet it would work.

For now I'm just going to try and cut a second slot in the existing hub.

Well I made this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5239

I snapped the old 1mm end mill while trying to probe the coordinate system, and replaced it with a fresh one,
which I expected to work better, but it raised an awful burr.

I recall that the old end mill had 1 cutting edge broken, but maybe that was a blessing in disguise because it turns
it into a single-flute cutter. So:

 * should I be running the 2-flute cutter at only 12000 rpm?
 * should I be feeding the 2-flute cutter at 200 mm/min?
 * should I grind one of the teeth off?
 * should I try to buy 1mm single-flute cutters?
 * should I try to *make* 1mm single-flute cutters?

Being able to make my own cutters would be very handy, although it is faff. For stuff like this (i.e. no plunging) I think a
D-bit might work OK. And that then opens the door to even smaller end mills.
Definitely something to investigate.

I put it together, and the first impression is that it is winding! It is winding really nice and evenly, but does not appear
to be remotely springy.

Here it is fully wound: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5240

It is displaying no tendency at all to rotate the shaft on its own.

I loosened the screws slightly and it looks like it is... almost working? Sort of working? I only get about 3/4 of a turn on it
before it starts to bind up, and if I keep trying to turn it after that point then it won't unwind on its own.

I think the wire is too long, i.e. has too many coils inside the barrel, so there's not enough room to wind it up/down.
