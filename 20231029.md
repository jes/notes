## Stepper motor clock

Progress has been disrupted somewhat this weekend, but should be back to normal tomorrow.

Latest is the clock is mostly assembled:

I fixed the worst tight spot in the train by reprinting the first wheel with a slightly smaller
pinion, and I fixed the anti-reverse feature by making the slots in the Geneva-driven wheel
bigger, and moving the steel pin slightly closer to its centre of rotation.

So now the clock works, including the anti-reverse feature.

The magnetic slip fitting to allow the setting of the hands seems to have tight spots, which
makes setting the hands very difficult. Also there is some play in the minute hand because
I accidentally cut the flat on the shaft too deep. So setting the time by moving the minute hand is
inadvisable, instead it is better to rotate the gear that drives the minute hand, so maybe the plan
is I should make some sort of fitting that allows turning that gear with a key. So much for not
needing a key. Or maybe I just live with turning the gear by hand.

Still to do:

* screw the motor in place
* fit a heatsink
* build some sort of box at the back to house the wiring, with a clear plastic cover
* fit the dial feet
* make a dial
* make hands out of something stronger?
* take it apart, varnish the wood, reassemble
* demo video, blog

## Tomorrow

* tidy the office
* proceed with stepper motor clock
