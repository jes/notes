I'm making a storage rack for lengths of rod, tube etc.

It's pretty shoddily constructed, but I just want to get it welded up quickly and move on.

Can take big pieces at the bottom and small pieces at the top. It is only tacked up now,
and it still needs some horizontal bracing.

Some great info in this vid, notably:

 * a gridiron pendulum is meant to grow very slightly under temperature increase
 * moving weight up, in the top half of the pendulum, makes it tick slower (??? I should check this)
 * ideally the pendulum will tick slower as the amplitude increases, so that you can adjust the
   drive weight to compensate for pressure variation
