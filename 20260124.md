## Car chassis rails

I made a 3d-printed jig to clamp them: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6455

It wasn't a massive success as it was too flexible, as you can see I had to remove my first attempt at a tack and try again.
But it was a good reference to verify the angle after-the-fact.

To tack up the second rail I clamped it to the first: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6456

I wasn't sure whether to grind back the welds or not, in the end I did: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6457

I started trying to drill for the axle with the 30mm holesaw but the run-out on this thing is absurd: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6458o

It is wandering by about 3x the blade thickness. And the cordless drill battery was flat so it is on charge now.
