## Tractor

I've tidied up the garage, it doesn't take very long and instantly makes the space more inviting
for working on things. I should keep it tidier more often.

I have had a go at "kerf bending", it hasn't gone well:

I used the calculator and left a 3mm thickness (as per the default) and I could tell it wouldn't bend without
snapping. So then I cut all the grooves deeper but it still felt like it was going to snap, but I forced it,
and then it snapped. Bugger.

I think the grain direction of the outer ply needs to be the other way, which I didn't think of until
after I snapped it, but at any rate I didn't have enough length in the other direction so it had to be this
way anyway, or else having the top/front surface of the bonnet made out of 2 pieces.

Since the wood had snapped anyway I continued bending it to see what would happen.

Actually doesn't look too awful? With a bit of sanding I might be able to salvage this?

I can live with this. I glued up the inside to make it a bit stronger:

Once that glue has set I am going to attach battens to the insides of this bent piece, and then
attach the sides to the battens, and then it should be strong enough to hold its shape and I can
have a go at sanding out the lumps.

In the worst case I buy more plywood and try again.
