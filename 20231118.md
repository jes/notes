## Scotch Yoke escapement

The printer ran out of filament overnight, so the barrel isn't done, but I can use the rest, except
the pendulum top has the slot in the wrong place so it obviously won't work. How did I manage that?
So I need to print a fixed pendulum top, and a barrel.

It's not very good. The barrel diameter is too big, and it's not geared down, so it doesn't run for very long.
And the bearing is too sloppy in the slot so it clunks every time it passes the maximum amplitude.

So I'm going to make a much smaller barrel, and try to somehow make the slot narrower.

Not too bad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRFbPuerHZ8

A bit jerky but could definitely be worse. I'm not sure how you can stop it being jerky without making the
pin rub against the slot. Maybe rubbing the slot is fine. I think part of the issue in the vid is that the bearing is
touching the chamfer instead of the actual slot.

So much for it being silent!

I probably want to add some spacers and collars to keep everything positioned correctly,
and power it through a geartrain to make a clock.

## Garage

I tied up the garage & am feeling a lot happier about the space now. Will be good to get new
shelving up and move stuff around so it is more functional.

I also machined the serrations off the vice jaws, here's before and after: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5018

However when doing a finish pass on the second jaw, this happened: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5019

D'oh! The G-code program I wrote cut at Z=0 and left the tool at Z=5 after it was done, so to make it do a 0.1mm depth
of cut on the next run I "touched off" Z at 5.1. Then I re-ran the job and it wasn't cutting, so I stopped it
and touched off at Z=5.1 again, forgetting that the job hadn't parked at Z=5 because I stopped it before it was done.
I need a better way to say "re-run the same job but 0.1mm lower" that doesn't involve manually adding (and remembering
to add rather than subtract!) 0.1mm to the current Z coordinate.

This evening I plan to design a magnetic bracket to hold the plastic Vernier caliper to the carriage,
I took this pic for reference: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5017

## Next

 * assemble and test the 1x plastic escapement
 * re-fit escape wheel and pinion on metal escapement
 * clamp hairspring to metal escapement frame
 * make some spacers and a geartrain for the Scotch Yoke escapement
 * organise garage
