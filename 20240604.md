Plan:

 * tidy the garage
 * join the lamp stand pieces together
 * make progress on CNC machine

## Flatpack table

I made this:

Lucy had some fun playing with it, she seems to understand that the screws go in the holes, and that
she needs to apply the screwdriver to the screw, but she doesn't yet grasp that you tighten/loosen the
screw by rotating. She keeps trying to push the screws in straight. Good progress though.

## Lamp base

The design is kind of chosen just to be a smoothish shape that doesn't need too much material removal.
Material removal is unwanted, because it takes a long time and makes the base lighter.

Flattened one side on the CNC machine:

Now flip it over and make the actual shape.
