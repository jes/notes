## Douzieme gauge

I took the "Tomorrow" list from yesterday into the garage and went through the items
in order. It turned out I already had a version of FreeCAD on the garage computer that
I had simply forgotten about. I updated it anyway. Must remember it is there and I can use
it.

I didn't come up with a very effective way to clamp the parts to the table:

But it turned out to be adequate. I should really get some strap clamps for the milling machine.

Left shows the first type of spring I tried to make, middle shows a circlip tool,
and right shows my take on copying the spring design from the circlip tool:

Pretty pleased with this so far. Next up is to start making the scale. The spring sometimes falls out,
not sure what to do about that. Maybe I need to make another spring with longer "hooks" on the ends
and hook them through the holes a bit better.
