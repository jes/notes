The board printed overnight, and I printed a letter this morning: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4888

Both at 80% scale and on the "0.15mm DETAIL" setting. The print quality is for the most part very good.

I might try printing one on a "raft", because the bottom layer isn't great. Also might make the letter
larger as there is quite a lot of slop in it. I reckon there's about 1.6mm gap, and the cube is 24mm across,
so to take up half the gap the cube needs to be 24.8/24 = 1.0333x as big. 1.0333 * 80 = 82.6666, so I need
to print it at about 82.6% scale.

Also it almost certainly wants a weight inside. So I'll go and cut a bit of 12mm rod.
I cut the rod with the angle grinder and then faced it to length in the 3-jaw chuck in the lathe. Taking it out,
measuring it, putting it back in, taking a bit more off, etc.

So let's try the same cube print, but with a raft, 82.6% scale, and a rod inside.

If you right click on a layer height in PrusaSlicer you can pick "pause print at layer".

On the first attempt the nozzle jammed, I'm guessing some of the blue fibrous stuff was stuck in the hotend.

I cleared it out a bit and then it worked. Here it is just after I put the rod in:

There is a discontinuity at the pause layer, like it was under-extruding when it resumed. This will obviously
not be as bad if I do all 16 in one build plate because then only one of them will suffer. If I could work out
what order it would resume them in, I could make it resume on some dummy part to use up the under-extrusion
and then print all the cubes properly.

It's not obvious that the raft is an improvement.

Here's the comparison after cleaning up with a knife: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4890

I could consider trying to print them in 2 halves and glue them together after, not sure that would be better though.

As for how it works... well it does work better than with the cube that is too small and light. It still doesn't
work as well as the one with the full-diameter ramp though. But I can't really put that in the game because then
2 cubes could get stuck on one ramp. Maybe this is good enough? I reckon make 15 more metal rods, print the 15
other letter pieces, and see how it goes.

I can make an initial lid by using hexagonal infill or something to let you look through. I probably want some
frosted perspex for the real one though.

So, next jobs on Boggle:

* cut 15 metal rods 12mm x 12mm
* setup a print job for all the letter cubes about from HLNNRZ
* print the cubes at 82.6% scale, work out what time it is likely to pause, wait for it to pause, put the rods in, resume
* see how well the game board work
* make a lid
