## Plan

Print out the guard dart system, make a longer spring, try it out, plot natural frequency of balance wheel
& isochronicity charts again.

Tidy the garage, clean the lathe, make a chip-guard for the back of the lathe.

CAD a Douzieme gauge, make it, blog it.

## Hairspring winder

Well I printed the guard dart system out but I couldn't wind a satisfactory hairspring by hand, so I designed
this hairspring winder based on one in the "Watch and Clock Making and Repairing" book:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4700

Here's the one from the book:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4703

The idea is you hook 3 pieces of wire to the inside of one piece, and feed them through the slots
in the other piece, and then rotate the pieces to coil the 3 wires up tightly together, and then you take
it apart and you've got 3 hairsprings. Will it work? I don't know. The most likely failure is that the
3d printing is not precise enough to properly constrain the 0.7mm wire.

I had a lot of difficulty loading the wire, because it keeps falling out of its hook. I think if it were a hole
you poke it in instead of a hook that lies in the same plane, it would be easier. I eventually taped down the
3 pieces of wire, with the idea that the winding motion would rip the tape off.

I also had a lot of difficulty bolting it up, because I had to hold an M3 nut and bolt at the same time as holding
the lid shut with my fingers. I should put an M3 insert in the bottom part.

I also had a lot of difficulty doing the winding, because the tool is so small. I think it would be better if the
handle on the top part were easier to grab, and if the bottom part had a rectangular piece to clamp in the vice.

When I opened it, it looked like this:

So the tape didn't rip up as easily as I hoped, and also the pieces didn't clamp together firmly enough so the wires
were able to ride over each other.

Also it doesn't spring out very much once it's released, so I should make it bigger.

Let's try and design an improved version, using what we learnt...

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4704

I know it looks similar but it is much larger. The grip on the top part is 10mm tall instead of 3mm.

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4706

A bit more convincing, it still seemed like the wires were riding over each other though. Maybe try again with
a clamping washer. Actually, this will do, I can work with this.

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4707

Boom.

Almost every data point is the exact same frequency. This is plotting 3 runs, but most of the time all 3 are on
top of each other, which means the tick rate is consistent to within 1 frame of video, over like 5 seconds.

Very good, much better than before. I will measure the isochronicity of the escapement with the guard dart,
but if the isochronicity is good enough now even at low amplitudes, then I think we can skip the guard dart idea
and focus more effort on making a good balance wheel.

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4708

Mmm, actually not as good as last time (the coefficient on the log is 0.021 vs 0.017), although from 7 nuts
upwards the actual data points look almost perfectly flat, at least within measurement error. If we follow
the trend line, then from about 7 to 14 nuts is only a 1% change in tick rate.

One reason it might be worse is because the hairspring was clonking against the frame ever so slightly, which I
guess means it acts slightly longer in one direction than the other?

With 14 nuts, we have 130 degrees amplitude: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4709

Seems like this would be possible even with the captive impulse pin?? Need to check.

Lol, just realised the guard dart I made doesn't even work because it allows the lever to start moving just
*before* the pin enters it. That settles it then: no guard dart, it's too much trouble.

So I'm saying let's just go with `lever-escapement-prototype3.FCStd` for now and stop trying to improve it.
If it proves to be defective then I can revisit.

## Douzieme gauge

I designed this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4701

Based on the reference photo from the other day: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4690

I'm planning to drill a hole on the inside of each leg and bend up a bit of stainless wire to make
the spring. The pivot will be held together with an M3 bolt with a big washer, with one leg tapped, and maybe
loctited. I still need to make the engraving pattern for the scale.

It's meant to be made out of 3mm steel, but if I find that too annoying I may revert to aluminium.

## Garage

Garage is tidied, lathe is cleaned: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4705

After lunch, make a chip-catcher.

Probably also want to fit the new blade to the bandsaw, and put it away somewhere, and maybe
look at the tailstock of the lathe and see why it doesn't clamp properly any more.

I cut up an offcut of roofing to make a chip-catcher:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4710

While I'm thinking about the lathe: the carriage microscope is slightly too close to the work, the
position where it's in focus is just beyond the end of its travel. Also it doesn't have enough travel
left/right or forward/back, so I should make a new mount for it that rectifies these problems. Also
the mount is a bit floppy, and it would be better if the eyepieces ended up at 45 degrees instead of
vertical.

## Case mockup

I designed this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4711

It has a dummy movement (i.e. no movement), but it is setup so that turning the yellow ring clockwise
"winds it up" (spins freely), and turning it anticlockwise rotates the dummy movement inside the case.
The hand is just fixed to the movement.

I don't like having the exposed screws on the top of the bezel, I would build the case the other way
up next time (i.e. a plate screws on the bottom side, not the top side). And I don't really like
the visual complexity,

Maybe some of the visual complexity is just from the colours and transparency, but it's still not
exactly a pretty watch even with that turned off:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4712

So at some point I will need to make it look nice, but for now this should be good enough to demonstrate the
setting/winding principle, and find out whether it is easy enough to grab the winder.

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4713

A 1h13 print, will be done about 10pm, at this rate I might be able to do several iterations before tomorrow!
Hopefully this one works though. The most likely failure is the clicks for the ratchets, and thankfully they
are the smallest parts.
