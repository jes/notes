## Neural net images

After 239 rounds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXTM76gQs3w

Not really improving very much. Maybe the input images are too high-resolution so training takes too long.
I'm going to split the training data up into 100 different sets that each only have 1% of the data, and choose
a random one each time. Will that help? Not sure. I'll try it anyway.

Also, this is what it looks like if you extrapolate past the trained region: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5381

You can sort of see the face in the middle and just random patterns outside. It might look clearer if the face
were trained a bit better.

The one from jes/Feynman is more interesting: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5382

More evidence that it has learnt the pictures at 2 points in space and has coloured everything else black.

Running with only 1% of the input pixels (even though there are 100 different sets with a different 1% each)
doesn't seem to work very well, it's converged on this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5383

But since I'm saving out the weights periodically, I can start from this point but now use 10% of the data each
time, and then when that plateaus I can use 100%.

Hmm, this is not working right. It seems like even when I load the weights in from a file the training resets it?
Is it setup so that the training is excessively powerful at first or something?

Reading it in and saving it straight back out gives an identical file. Not sure what is going on here.

## 3d printer

Since I'm making such slow progress on making a clock/watch out of metal, I've been thinking that perhaps I
should lower my ambitions and make a 3d-printed mechanical clock first. But some of my recent prints haven't been
very satisfactory, so I thought I should do some printer improvements.

I've got a new PrusaSlicer, and fresh Prusa Mini firmware. I wanted to use Input Shaping but there is no profile from Prusa
for Input Shaping with a 0.6mm nozzle so that will have to wait.

It is still showing slight under-extrusion: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5384

The lines at bottom left of the hull for example are not even touching each other. And on the perimeter of the "box" behind the
cabin.

Possible causes:

 * filament too narrow
 * extruder slipping
 * extruder too tight (if the gear is digging in too deep then the filament is being pushed by a smaller diameter?)
 * hotend not assembled correctly (feed pressure not being transmitted to the nozzle properly?)

If the filament is the wrong diameter then it's at least close enough that I can't tell.

There was some ground filament packed into the extruder gear, which I've cleaned out.

If the extruder tension screw is meant to be flush with the housing (is it?) then it was too tight by 1 or 2 turns.

And let's print another boat using the same G-code and see if it is any better.

I'm not going to reassemble the hotend because I tried doing that several times before and don't recall making any improvement.
If adjusting the extruder tension and cleaning out the extruder gear doesn't fix it then I'm tempted to buy a new hotend.

Either this upgrade kit from Slice Engineering (£72 + shipping): https://www.sliceengineering.com/collections/prusa-3d-printer-upgrades/products/prusa-mini-upgrade-kit

Or just a heatbreak + heater block from Prusa (£19 + shipping): https://www.prusa3d.com/en/product/hotend-heatbreak-mini/ and https://www.prusa3d.com/en/product/hotend-heaterblock-mini/

But looking at those parts, they don't really look like they would wear out. Maybe I just need to rebuild the hotend I have
more thoroughly.

## Tomorrow

The plan tomorrow is to get back to building the new CNC machine. Next steps from [2024-03-25](20240325.md) were:

 * go around the important edges with a file smoothing out the "layer lines" and making them perpendicular
 * file a dog-bone in the inside corner on the first upright
 * set up a square on the CNC router table to do op2 for: table, Z plate, X carriage, they're all small
   and rectangular so a sensible square should be able to do all 3
 * clean all the dust off, especially out of the holes
 * glue in threaded inserts
 * assemble the machine

I want to take time and pay attention to making the important edges perpendicular, and to making the square on the CNC table
actually square. Take time, pay attention, and don't do a bad job.
