## CNC machine

Next steps were:

 * connect up the earth on the motor cable, and clip it to the board, and maybe cover the exposed live terminals with a 3d printed
 * put some chokes on the motor/VFD cables? I have some in the drawer in the office
 * connect up coolant to the spindle motor
 * sort out cable management inside the tub, and the ones that need to move on the Z axis should be suspended from the ceiling
 * shim the gantry
 * test cuts!

OK, earth is connected up now, and I've put a choke near the VFD on both the supply
cable and the cable going out to the motor.

Next up, coolant.

I made an aluminium barb adapter to connect the hose to the pump, it is just an interference fit, seems good: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5540

OK, coolant is plumbed in. I really need to wire it up so that it comes on automatically when
the machine is on and goes off automatically when the machine is off. The pump is very quiet so
I am liable to accidentally leave it running. Ignore this for now though. The plug is on the
desk, needs to be either unplugged or switched off at the wall.

I feel like ignoring cable management inside the tub, and ignoring shimming the gantry, and making a start on
some test cuts. Just need a method to fix something to the table.

Here's a piece of HDPE clamped to the table. The clamps will interfere with the frame if it moves too far, so I have quite limited
cutting area.

The spindle is turning backwards, new assignment is:

 * 1: V: red
 * 2: U: white
 * 3: W: black
 * 4: earth: green

And I have a piece of test gcode to run on the plastic. Let's give it a go!

First test:

 * HDPE
 * 9000rpm (150Hz)
 * 2mm down-cutting 6mm carbide end mill
 * 2000mm/min feed rate
 * full slotting, 6mm
 * 1mm depth of cut

Beautiful! Really good cut, worked first time.

Let's try incrementally increasing the depth of cut until either I run out of material or
something goes wrong.

2mm and 3mm depth of cut worked perfectly well too!

A 4mm cut would go all the way through, so I'll move over a bit and try maybe 6mm.

For a larger depth of cut the calculator was asking for a higher rpm, so I bumped it up
to 11700 rpm for the bigger cut.

Worked pretty well, the step over was 5mm so I don't know why there was a thin web left
standing, there should have been 1mm overlap between passes.

Maybe now some aluminium?

It suggested 16000rpm for a 4-flute 6mm cutter, but this is just way too fast,
it made a melty mess, and lots of chip-weld in my nice brand new cutter.

It did cut it though. (Is it possible that my rpm is miscalibrated
and it is actually doing 2x what I asked for? I don't think so. It did sound very loud
though).

I've told it the max rpm is 8000 (133 Hz), now we have to reduce feed rate to 1500 mm/min, OK.

I ran that as a spring pass, and it cleaned it up a lot but again picked up some chip-weld.

Let's try 4000 rpm (67Hz). Now only 900 mm/min. I think I might be better off with
a single-flute cutter. Seems a lot better. Now I'll do this at 1mm depth-of-cut.

Err, no good. It stalled.

Oh! I do have a single-flute cutter, let's try that, and 12000 rpm (200Hz).

This was much happier, but left a bit of chip weld on the walls. Does that mean higher
feed rate required? Or lower? Let's try lower rpm, maybe 10000 rpm (167Hz).

Seems similar, maybe slightly better. I'll try lower feed rate as well, 750mm/min.

So now we're on 750mm/min, 10000rpm (167 Hz), and 1mm depth of cut.

I think I'm happy with this, let's try 2mm depth of cut.

It got through the cut, but there was some chip-welding on the walls. I think with
maybe an air blast or flood coolant it might work better. I'm going to try running a larger
test with 10000 rpm and 750 mm/min and see how it looks.

Great success.

This is a material removal rate of 9 cm^3/min, which is higher than even the theoretical
maximum of the old machine. Good. And the theoretical maximum for this machine is more
like 40 cm^3/min according to the feeds and speeds calculator.

Next steps:

 * clean out the tub, tidy up the garage
 * sort out cable management, suspend cables/hoses for Z axis from above
 * shim the gantry, consider using "air-drying clay" to fill out the voids.
 * machine some holes into the table and glue in threaded inserts for attaching a sacrificial surface or the vice
 * bolt down the vice and make a test square and test circle in the top of some material, and measure it for accuracy
