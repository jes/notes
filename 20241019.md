## John Harrison and his Timekeepers

I scanned this book in today: https://incoherency.co.uk/interest/john-harrison-and-his-timekeepers.pdf

Scanned at pretty low res because my scanner is quite slow and takes time proportional to the resolution, but perfectly
readable I'd say.

The "plates" (apart from the first one with teh pic of Harrison) are scanned at a higher resolution.

And then after each page was scanned I rotated and cropped it in Gimp, and then put them all together as a PDF.

Still needs OCR.

I tried "pdf24" OCR, but it did a really bad job.
