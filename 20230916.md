## Staking tools

Contrary to the "plan" I wrote yesterday, I decided to try and make some
staking tools today.

I wanted to make a big flat piece of metal with various-sized holes in it
that I can use to hammer shafts through gears.

I went to great pains to square up the piece of D2 tool steel that I had,
fly-cutting every surface, draw filing, chamfering the edges, and even
polishing the two large flat faces (a bit).

Then I put the 1.1mm PCB drill in the pillar drill, and... I couldn't drill
a hole. Eventually I snapped the drill off. This steel is too hard.

Then I tried a 2mm drill, but because it doesn't have the large shank
like the PCB drills do, I couldn't hold it in the chuck.

Then I tried a 3mm drill, and I did manage to drill a hole but it was tough
going. It felt like if I paused at all, the material work-hardened and was
then very difficult to push through, until I broke through and it drilled
quite well for a while.

So I think D2 tool steel is not a good material for me to use, it is too
difficult to work with.

I do have a block of mild steel that I could use instead, but if I try this
again I won't bother going to so much trouble to make the material nice
before I've managed to drill any holes...

This guy has a decent homemade Tourbillon project on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlT8Gdg_m4c
He has a big and professional Haas machine, but some of the techniques are applicable anyway.

I had another go in a piece of aluminium: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4633

I did try to drill a 0.6mm hole in the middle (where the "X" is) using the pillar drill,
but snapped off the PCB drill. I then tried a 0.7mm PCB drill, while wearing the 5x loupe,
and managed to drill it some of the way! I stopped pretty early though, didn't want to
push my luck. Then I wondered if I could make the hole deeper by drilling by hand using
the pin vice, and I snapped off the 0.7mm drill, leaving part of it behind in the hole.

Probably I should be using either the router or the milling machine when drilling these
tiny holes. Or don't make them so deep. I only need the top 1 mm or so to be at
the correct diameter, the rest of the depth can be counter-drilled from the other side
to whatever arbitrary diameter is easy.
