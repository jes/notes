## Emma's lamp

This is the wood we've started off with:

The plan is to turn the pieces down on Ruari's lathe, and screw them together
with threaded rods, and fit a lampshade & battery-powered bulb at the top.

I've cut the square pieces down to octagons to save time on the lathe.

Then into CAD to plan the design of the upright bit:

We settled on:

And a 3d-printed template for reference on the lathe: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5467

## Machine building

Finally got the gantry bolted on:

The holes almost lined up perfectly, just had to drill out 3 or 4 of them to 7mm.

Next up is motor brackets.

The short version of the motor bracket does *not* work on the X axis even with the coupler pushed
all the way in. The long version *does* work on the Y axis.

I've transferred the hole locations on to the gantry & baseplate. I'm not sure how accurately they're going to
end up being positioned. I can use the brackets as gluing templates so it should be fine, or failing that
I can make new brackets with slotted holes.
