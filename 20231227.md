## Planar verge escapement

What about having 2 escape wheels geared together to turn in opposite directions at the same speed,
and both pressing against a shared "flag" on the balance shaft?

Like this:

Obviously make the flag shorter and move the balance shaft closer than in that diagram.

That might work just like a normal verge escapement, including allowing amplitudes up to almost 90 degrees?

So an improvement compared to my previous "planar verge" escapement, and also probably less sliding friction.

Here's another version of a planar verge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab5CN5rSlTo

I think the one in my drawing is probably better because it is easier to make and maintains symmetry. Although it is true that
the "secondary" escape wheel in my drawing will be floating free in the backlash while the "primary" escape wheel
is engaged with the flag. But probably we don't care.

You could even imagine separating the escape wheels further and having them work against 2 separate pallets. The secondary
escape wheel can be driven off an idler from whatever drives the primary.
