## Roof

I've screwed the strange-shaped flap down to the wall, filled its cavity with spray foam,
and siliconed everywhere else. Tomorrow I need to silicone the strange-shaped flap and
then I'm done with silicone I think. Oh, need to seal the gutter as well.

## Car

So next job is to try to access the fuel tank and either clean it out or work out what is
wrong. This would be more convenient if there were less fuel in it, but that risks making
the problem happen again.

New plan: I've cleaned all the loose crap from around the filler cap and put some Redex in it.
I bought enough Redex to do the next 4 fill-ups. If the problem returns then I'll reconsider.
