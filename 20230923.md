## Lever escapement

Concepts to explore:

 * fixing the escape wheel tooth geometry
 * making the slot in the lever just an over-sized circle
 * putting the slot in the wheel instead of the lever

### Tooth geometry

This is almost the same tooth geometry as before, except with a 1.6mm radius at the root of
the locking face, and a 10mm radius at the root of the unused face:

In `lever-escapement-prototype3`.

That looks much more like a normal one. Those radii don't really change the geometry of the tooth,
they just make it stronger and prettier (and prevent "wedging" in the root of the locking face).

Update: it doesn't work. Need to work out what went wrong.

I think this could have been figured out in CAD. Here both pallets are hitting the escape wheel:

### Over-sized circle slot

This is the biggest circle that I can fit that allows the pin to pass through the centre position,
and also provides sensible clearance from the balance wheel shaft:

In `lever-escapement-prototype3`.

The benefit of making it circular is that it can then be drilled instead of requiring tiny milling.

### Slot in the wheel

One obvious downside is it increases the weight at the centre of the balance wheel, we'd rather it
have all its weight at the perimeter I think.

I actually think it might not be possible to put the slot in the wheel instead of the lever,
because after the slot has pushed the lever to one side so that the slot can go past, and then
the balance wheel reverses, how can the slot push on the lever?

Is the lever going to be pushed by the "top" of the slot or the "bottom"?

In `lever-escapement-prototype4`, if I manage it.

### Asymmetrical pallets?

This photograph from "Watch and Clock Making and Repairing" by W. J. Gazeley shows that
the pallets are not centered equidistant from the pivot:

Instead the locking faces of the pallets are equidistant - I should do the same thing.
