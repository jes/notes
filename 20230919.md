## Roof

Plan today:

* block off the "rafters" (?)
* put strips up to space the plasterboard away from the aluminium (will I need longer screws?)
* silicone the gutter
* silicone against the wall if it's dry enough
* put insulation up
* post Paul's coin (maybe include a Â£2 pacman if there's time)
