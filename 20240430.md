## Numeric form value encoding

Let's say you have a form like the Oscillating Engine Simulator one:

https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5428

And you want to convert the contents of the form into a string that users can copy/paste to
save/restore the values, share in DMs, spreadsheet columns, etc.

Also I really want to maintain the *string* value of each number (i.e. distinguish "2.5" from
"2.50000" etc.), to faithfully recreate the actual contents.

Essentially I want to encode numeric-valued form contents in a short string that is easily copy/pastable.

The first thing that springs to mind is to encode the form in JSON, with numbers as strings.
That has the advantage that it is easy to do and easy to hand-edit, but it is long,
and double-click-to-select-all doesn't work because of all the word boundaries.

    {"bore":"15","stroke":"30","gap":"4.75","pistonrod":"63","pivotsep":"67.5","portswing":"12","inletdia":"2.5","exhaustdia":"2.5","cyldia":"2","inletangle":"-14.5","exhaustangle":"14.5","flywheeldia":"68","flywheelmoi":"0.000203","atmos":"101.325","supply":"50","reservoir":"12000","fillport":"0.7","static":"0.0136","speeddep":"-0.00003347","sqrspeeddep":"0.0000000588","load":"0"}

That's 380 bytes.

(Without loss of generality I'm only encoding the numeric values; other values can be passed in broadly
the same way).

If we're loading/saving the same form every time then we can drop the field names and just make it an array
of values:

    ["15","30","4.75","63","67.5","12","2.5","2.5","2","-14.5","14.5","68","0.000203","101.325","50","12000","0.7","0.0136","-0.00003347","0.0000000588","0"]

153 bytes.

Since we know that we're making an array of strings, we can drop the square brackets and quote marks, and just transfer comma-separated values:

    15,30,4.75,63,67.5,12,2.5,2.5,2,-14.5,14.5,68,0.000203,101.325,50,12000,0.7,0.0136,-0.00003347,0.0000000588,0

109 bytes.

But it is longer than necessary, and we still have the issue that double-click-to-select-all doesn't work.
We could fix the double-clicking issue without making it any longer by (for example) replacing commas with "A", decimal
points with "B", and minus signs with "C":

    15A30A4B75A63A67B5A12A2B5A2B5A2AC14B5A14B5A68A0B000203A101B325A50A12000A0B7A0B0136AC0B00003347A0B0000000588A0

So we're still at 109 bytes.

My idea is let's encode these values with a sort of "base11" which is like the normal base 10, plus a 10th fake digit that encodes
the comma. We split each number into 2 values: one before the decimal point and one after.

And the rest is along the same lines as https://github.com/jes/chess-steg - form this big value as a bignum, and then write it
out in base64. And in forming the bignum we can use the "variable base" idea to
insert a sign bit in front of every integer part.

So how long does that end up being?

The number we get is:

    522035207404143755986838511646149911090601406833074548504285605901409306612626322367767620165551368371428668549753190300443098832819140940011788

That's 59 bytes of actual information, but takes up 144 bytes encoded in ASCII.

    DBkIEazg/UACBeGwIx6j3cDFu846MT7VubzCWQDRpKgW1TFRa1ENaTiCGfOGlLWj3vcyMstGkBdHRs8q

80 bytes after the raw value is base64'd, which I think is the best we're going to do.

But I don't like the "+" and "/" characters in base64, I prefer base58. That gets us:

    8A1s1KCJbCamByaY7xE6eUb2GHRobWv1RNQhtPPCgA9hATgkLZgWsqjhBCEX6jeswKd8SaZuhQaK85iecS

Which is 82 bytes and no special characters.

Out of curiosity I want to know how large all the other intermediate stages would be after compressing
with zlib (which I understand to be gzip minus header?) and encoding with base58:

 * JSON object: 297 bytes
 * JSON array: 119 bytes
 * CSV: 96 bytes
 * CSV but alphanumeric: 97 bytes

So compressing a CSV actually gets you pretty close! 82 bytes for my scheme vs 96 bytes (+17%) for compressed CSV.
I expected compressed CSV to do much worse on such a short string. Obviously compressed CSV will win out eventually as
the string gets longer, but the example case I'm using here is already long for the kind of use-case I have in mind.
Most of my forms don't have that many fields.

Next up:

 * come up with a sensible name for it (I don't like "base11", maybe "num58"? "form58"?)
 * write a JavaScript lib for encoding/decoding (obviously support script tags, but maybe try to do the npm thing as well?)
 * add support to Oscillating Engine Simulator, Escapement Simulator, more?
 * github project with sensible README
 * blog (basically paste the content of this note & tidy it up)
