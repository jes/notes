## DeWinner tool

The oscillating multitool isn't working, even with the battery charged. When you turn it on
the light flashes briefly and the motor moves a tiny bit, then it goes off again.

I took it apart and didn't spot anything wrong. I switched it on and off a few times in
quick succession and saw some smoke coming from the circuit board. On closer inspection
one of the diodes is cracked:

They are marked "RS2M".

I have ordered a pair of replacements, will fit when they arrive, hopefully that fixes it.

## Clock weight

My 10kg of lead shot has arrived. It is heavy and I need something to hold it.

I cut off a section of aluminium tube, faced the ends, and polished it very slightly.

I machined it on the lathe, very carefully, without the use of a steady rest:

It seemed to work OK.

To get it to run true I pressed the end of a file handle against it and then tightened
the chuck jaws, that worked well.

So now the plan is to 3d print a top cap and a bottom cap. The bottom cap probably
wants to be a tight fit and glue in place, the top cap wants to be able to unscrew,
so probably a male thread which gets pressed/glued onto the aluminium tube, and a female
part that screws on to it and holds the pulley.

There will be a lot of weight on the glued joints, so I'm thinking maybe drill some holes
in the aluminium to let the glue hold on mechanically.

If the end caps fall off it will be pretty catastrophic because lead shot will fall
everywhere. So one idea is to line it with a plastic bag or something? Another idea is
to just make sure that the end caps can hold more than 10kg without breaking.

Bottom cap superglued on:

And filled with lead shot:

The bottom cap doesn't show any sign of trying to let go, so that's good. It is only 3kg
though, the packing efficiency is obviously not great.
