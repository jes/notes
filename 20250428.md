## Deadbeat escapement simulator

The plan is to expose a plot of "torque" to the scope, showing torque applied to the
pendulum from the escapement, and then see about adding an angle/torque plot similar to
the pressure/volume plot on the oscillating engine simulator.

And then simulate a "Tekippe regulator" and reply to John.

I actually don't know how to work out the torque on the anchor. I can `world.setAutoClearForces(false)` and then look at `anchor.m_torque` - but it is always 0. I think because the torque
is applied to the anchor by a force instead of a torque.

Could I work out the implied torque on the anchor by looking at its angular velocity? And
then subtract out what I know the torque from gravity would be?

Yes, that works.

And I am getting somewhere with the plot, although there are a lot of glitches in the
computed torque, I guess because of numerical issues in Planck.js.

Here's a glitch-free screenshot: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6159

And the example from https://groups.io/g/Horological-Science-Newsletter/topic/clock_b_vs_tekippe_s_clock/112278009 is:

And here's another example: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6161

That one shows:

 * glitch spikes at the left and right edge
 * impulse is asymmetric
 * an extra step towards the loops at left/right edge, compared to the reference diagram

One issue is that to get graphs that look this good I have multipled the computed
torque from gravity by 0.0012738. I could maybe accept multiplying by 0.001 if there is
a factor of 1000 confusion somewhere, but where does 1.2738 come from?

I think the "extra step" comes from the amplitude getting so high that the tooth actually falls
past the "top" of the resting face, so is totally bogus.

Changing the rod length means I need to change my 0.0012738 factor, quite dramatically.

A rod that is 1/10 of the length wants the factor to be about 0.111, so about 100x larger.

Could it be that my pallets are actually really heavy? And approximating gravity on the
pendulum by only looking at the bob is actually not right?

No, I have density 0 on the pallets.

OK, the issue may be that the moment of inertia of the anchor does not seem to depend on the rod length? Is that right?

Yes, I think that was it. I've made it calculate the pendulum moment of inertia itself instead
of using `anchor.m_I` and now I don't need the random fudge factor.

OK, good, so now how do I make it imitate a Tekippe regulator?

This is the clearest picture from the forum thread: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6163

We see that the escape wheel appears to be very small. John said over email that the amplitude
is only about 1 degree. And from the picture:

 * escape wheel teeth: **30**
 * anchor span: **12.5 teeth**

The angle/torque plot doesn't look very convincing.

This is looking a lot better: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6165

One thing I'm confused about is that the "loops" are the wrong side of the x axis?

A positive torque is pushing the anchor towards positive angles.

The largest-magnitude segments of the plot are the impulses.

If you ignore the vertical segments (step changes in applied torque) we have 6 horizontal(-ish) segments in a full cycle, consisting of 3 segments per half-cycle, or 3 segments per
pallet.

Starting from the drop, you have (1) frictional rest as the pallet swings towards the
escape wheel, then (2) frictional rest as the pallet swings away from the escape
wheel, then (3) impulse, followed by a drop on to the other pallet and the cycle repeats.

What's interesting is that frictional rests (1) and (2) don't exert the same amount of
torque at the same pendulum angle, even though the torque on the escape wheel is
constant. Why is that?

Intuitively it is harder to push something "against" a sharp tooth than "with" it. Is that
the answer? If so, I'm surprised the simulation reproduces that.

And the other confusing thing is that in my plot it looks like after the "right-going"
impulse (right-going as we look at the plot), the frictional rest is actually acting
like *more impulse* rather than like a brake? I'm guessing this is an issue with how I
am calculating the resultant torque. It should be a negative torque when the angle is
increasing and a positive torque when the angle is decreasing.

I could try reducing the time step and see if that error gets reduced. Not obvious
that it helps.

I think there is an error in the paper diagram from above, I think the frictional rest
should mirror across the x axis when the direction reverses. That way it is always retarding
the motion of the pendulum rather than accelerating it.

I think my calculation of gravity torque is not *quite* right, and that's the reason for the
rest torque being the wrong side of the x axis.

Changing the *diameter* of the bob changes the plot I get, which is not at all what I want.
I want to model the bob as a point mass. But making the bob diameter very small leads to
glitch spikes in the plot?

So instead let's calculate the pendulum moment of inertia taking the bob diameter into account,
when we subtract out the gravity torque.

And that works, we now see negative resting torque when the angle is increasing and
positive when it is decreasing.

Now it looks like this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6166

So, better, but still asymmetrical. Why is the frictional rest torque in one direction
so much higher than the other?

I tried setting the coefficient of friction to 0.0 and we still see positive torque
