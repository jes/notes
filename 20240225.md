## Spindle motor

I had another look at the 1.5kW spindle motor and found that the wavy washer in the top that allows for thermal
expansion is actually *2* wavy washers, and I had somehow assembled it with the waves out of phase with each other, which meant
the spacing was too big. I fixed that and put it all back together and all is fine now. I've installed it in the CNC
router and it works, and seems quieter than the 2.2kW one, so perhaps I should give that one the same treatment.

I do think I may have buggered up some of the bearing seals so that they're rubbing on the balls now, so it makes a slight
rubbing noise at low speeds, and it did get warm to the touch after only a few minutes' use, so I may have to address it again.
But I'm happy for now, it works.

## 4th axis

I put a very rough mockup of the 4th axis in the new machine CAD, and it looks like I may be able to use it,
but I may have to slide the spindle down in the clamp, otherwise the spindle clamp could hit the 4th axis

## G-code sender

I think Gio is maybe not as useful for me as I initially thought. It doesn't handle edge cases very well (e.g. if there
are too many buttons in a horizontal layout to fit on the screen, they don't wrap or scroll or anything, some of them just
go missing).

So my new plan is to separate everything I have so that the GUI part is all self-contained, and then swap the GUI out for
something using [Gotk4](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4).
