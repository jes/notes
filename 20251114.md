This is actually quite tricky to design.

I may want to change it so that the tilting plate axis passes through ground level, to make the angles
more realistic as viewed from the house. 

OK I think this design actually doesn't work. I don't think a single semi-static tilt for the ecliptic
is enough, because the earth always rotates around its own fixed axis. The earth rotation axis relative
to the house is constant regardless of time of year.

I need to think harder on this.
