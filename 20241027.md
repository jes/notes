## LAN Mode

I switched the Bambu printer to LAN mode but had some trouble getting it to work.

Apparently if it's on LAN mode then you need to install a MicroSD card otherwise it won't work. I don't see why
that's any different between LAN mode and Cloud mode, but installing a MicroSD card solved it.
