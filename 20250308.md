## Isoform ideas

 * some way to deform the domain of an object with 1-dimensional noise along an axis, or 2-dimensional noise along a plane, or 3-dimensional noise across all space
 * in the "pattern" tools we can let the user supply a noise function to deform the pattern domain without deforming the object domain
 * some way to make a surface defined by a noise function, like the terrain in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFld4EBO2RE (is this just a plane deformed by noise or is it different? and does it have a broken SDF?)
 * we can give an "EQ"-like UI for controlling noise functions
 * ellipsoids
 * scaling tool
 * "renormalise" option on features that aren't "exact"
 * track interior/exterior SDF correctness separately, and propagate correctness up the tree
