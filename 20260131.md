## Car rear wheel spacers

I've turned up this spacer material: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/6469

It is a tight fit in the bore of the hub, and a sliding fit on the rear axle.

I will cut it into 4 spacers and they will get pressed into the rear hubs to locate the rear wheels
on the axle. You can also see that I drilled the rear wheels for 6x M8 bolts at 100mm PCD, to attach
to the taper lock hubs. I still need to make the spacers for the bolts.

I'm unsure how to control the depth of the inner spot-face so that the spacers all end up at the same
height, so they are all pulled tight between the face on the inside of the wheel and the face of the
bolt-on hub.

One idea is to tightly control both the spot-face depth and the spacer length,
and then all the spacers are interchangeable. Another idea is to manually fit them one-by-one and mark
which spacer goes in which location.
