## Isochronous verge and foliot

Here's a crazy idea: forget about complicated escapements and balance springs, just use a verge and foliot.

What's the problem with a verge and foliot? It runs faster when more torque is applied. Why? Because the only torques
acting on the foliot are the speeding-up and slowing-down actions of the pallets.

*If* this means that the foliot runs faster in the long arcs, then my idea is that we put some centrifugal weights
on the foliot so that its moment of inertia increases when it is spinning faster. We can get some control over the rate at which
this happens by putting cheeks on the springs.

And, past that, we could potentially change the geometry of the pallets so that more torque is applied at the centre and
less at the ends.

I'm going to write a simulation to see if this looks anywhere near working. I'll start in Perl and if it looks like working
then I can change to JavaScript and add a visualisation.

Parts we have include:

 * 2 pallets, to start with we'll say these are radial on the foliot shaft
 * escape wheel, we'll say the teeth are flat surfaces
 * foliot with some fixed moment of inertia
 * centrifugal weights with some fixed mass, sprung such that they move outwards under centrifugal force
 * some constant drive torque applied to the escape wheel (which we'll vary to check isochronism)

As an initial further simplification we can say that the foliot receives a fixed torque towards the centre angle.
switching direction instantly as it crosses centre.

Initial impression is that for a drive torque variation of a factor of 5000, the period for 100 ticks
(with a fairly arbitrary selection of moment of inertia) varies by a factor of 70 without the centrifugal weights,
and with a good configuration of the weights (varying only the mass, initial radius, and spring constant), this is brought
down to a variation of a factor of 3. Obviously running 3x faster than normal is no good, but a torque variation of 5000x
is also well outside the normal range.

It is possible I made a mistake, and that the factor of 3 is not actually achievable (e.g. if you set the drive torque
so high that it always switches from one side of centre to the other in a single timestep, then it looks perfectly
isochronous even though it's not).

It is also possible that this required enormous weights swinging at enormous radii. I've tried to make the simulation
a bit more realistic to what I could actually fit inside a watch (although even if it is only workable at clock scale, it
could be a useful design anyway).

You increase the strength of the centrifugal effect by any of:

 * move the masses closer to the centre, so that they experience more centrifugal force
 * make the masses larger, so that their position influences the moment of inertia more
 * make the spring weaker, so that they move out further

It may turn out that even with the masses as close to the centre as you can get them, and as heavy as you can,
and with springs as weak as you can manage, the weights don't have enough control to make the balance isochronous
under varying drive torque, without having to fly out so far that they wouldn't even fit inside the movement any more.

I'm trying to calculate a configuration that will keep tick rate variation within 1% over a torque range of 10x,
and so far it seems to be plateauing around 25% tick rate variation. Maybe need to do more thinking and less brute
force search.

It seems to work a lot better if the spring obeys `F=k.x^2` instead of `F=k.x`. I've got it to within 3%
over a torque range of 10x, *maybe* this idea could work? But I think something is wrong because it is extremely
sensitive to changes like 8 significant figures in.

I'll leave this running but forget about it and go and work on gear-cutting.
