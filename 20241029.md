## Sovereign Scales

It's time!

I'm just going to make one, and try to do it well.

So I need to know where I'm putting holes in the sheet, and then Gcode for:

 * bottom side score lines
 * pockets
 * slots
 * pivot holes
 * cut out

I manually wrote gcode for the score lines, based on coordinates from CAD.

Drilled mounting holes need to be at:

 * X6 Y196
 * X6 Y132
 * X38 Y132
 * X38 Y4

First blunder: I got the top and bottom side reversed...

So we're putting the score lines on the good side of the brass and making the top surface out of the bad side. Never mind.

I ran it at 50% feed at first. Going down to Z=-2 at 1mm step down with the v-bit is not going to work.

Great, the v-bit is broken. Oh well, I have some grooves. May need to make the toolpath a lot lighter.

Now we need to flip over and run pocketing with the 6mm tool.

Workholding is like this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/img/5649

### TODO

 * make the v-bit toolpath take much lighter cuts (say 0.5mm on first pass and 0.25mm on subsequent ones?)
 * try harder to align the top and bottom sides?
 * if you go beyond Y0, the table hits the Y motor bracket, we should redesign the bracket to have a cutout to clear the table
