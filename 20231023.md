## Boggle

The board printed overnight, and I printed a letter this morning: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4888

Both at 80% scale and on the "0.15mm DETAIL" setting. The print quality is for the most part very good.

I might try printing one on a "raft", because the bottom layer isn't great. Also might make the letter
larger as there is quite a lot of slop in it. I reckon there's about 1.6mm gap, and the cube is 24mm across,
so to take up half the gap the cube needs to be 24.8/24 = 1.0333x as big. 1.0333 * 80 = 82.6666, so I need
to print it at about 82.6% scale.

Also it almost certainly wants a weight inside. So I'll go and cut a bit of 12mm rod.
I cut the rod with the angle grinder and then faced it to length in the 3-jaw chuck in the lathe. Taking it out,
measuring it, putting it back in, taking a bit more off, etc.

So let's try the same cube print, but with a raft, 82.6% scale, and a rod inside.

If you right click on a layer height in PrusaSlicer you can pick "pause print at layer".

On the first attempt the nozzle jammed, I'm guessing some of the blue fibrous stuff was stuck in the hotend.

I cleared it out a bit and then it worked. Here it is just after I put the rod in:

There is a discontinuity at the pause layer, like it was under-extruding when it resumed. This will obviously
not be as bad if I do all 16 in one build plate because then only one of them will suffer. If I could work out
what order it would resume them in, I could make it resume on some dummy part to use up the under-extrusion
and then print all the cubes properly.

It's not obvious that the raft is an improvement.

Here's the comparison after cleaning up with a knife: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4890

I could consider trying to print them in 2 halves and glue them together after, not sure that would be better though.

As for how it works... well it does work better than with the cube that is too small and light. It still doesn't
work as well as the one with the full-diameter ramp though. But I can't really put that in the game because then
2 cubes could get stuck on one ramp. Maybe this is good enough? I reckon make 15 more metal rods, print the 15
other letter pieces, and see how it goes.

I can make an initial lid by using hexagonal infill or something to let you look through. I probably want some
frosted perspex for the real one though.

So, next jobs on Boggle:

* cut 15 metal rods 12mm x 12mm
* setup a print job for all the letter cubes about from HLNNRZ
* print the cubes at 82.6% scale, work out what time it is likely to pause, wait for it to pause, put the rods in, resume
* see how well the game board work
* make a lid

It's a 9h45 print, and the pause is about 3/4 of the way up, so maybe I expect the pause to be after about 7h30?
So I could actually start it going before I go out, and it still won't be paused by the time I get back. I'm going to
start it printing and then go and make some rods.

It jammed up again. I think the issue is at 0.15mm layer height it starts off too close to the bed and can't force anything out,
and then grinds filament until it can't extrude anything. I've mode up the "live adjust Z" and will see how it goes.

Yes, looks to be putting down a decent first layer.

I've made 15 rods: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/4891

I cut them to length with the bandsaw, with the fence, but they weren't super consistent, so some of them ended up
slightly too short. That's why only some of them have lathe marks on the ends. They'll all be fine though.

The bandsaw cuts pretty well though. I reckon this was definitely quicker than hacksawing,
and the fence means it's more precise too (albeit not very precise). Not sure if it's quicker than angle-grinding,
but it's easier.

It paused at 79%, after 7h46m and with 2h01m remaining.

I noticed it actually does say in the slicer what timestamp it's going to pause at, but the formatting is janky
and it only shows when you hover over the position in the vertical layer slider thing. I put the pause at
layer Z=19.32, which might be one layer early, not sure, but I was very keen not to put it one layer too late.
Note this is with **2 raft layers** (and 82.6% scale).
If I do it at the same Z height with no raft layers, or different scale, it will obviously be wrong.

## Stepper motor clock

I've enlarged the shaft holes to 6mm. They'll then need to be turned down to 5mm for the portions that go through
the bearings, and this is good because it will locate the bearings properly. For collars I'm just going to use
a 3d-printed ring that presses onto the shaft. I wonder if it should be split, and made slightly under-size, so that
it is held in place by springing shut on the shaft?

I'll need a version for 5mm and a version for 6mm.

## Next tasks

So an updated plan is:

On Boggle:

* check that it works satisfactorily
* design the lid, put some branding on it
* work out how to paint the letters (ask mdg?)

On the stepper motor clock:

* design shaft collars
* acquire enough 6mm shaft (or check that I have enough)
* chamfer wheels?
* hands, face, case, make sure there is room for the transformer and wiring etc.

On the watch project:

* fix loose pallet pin
* make a collet & hairspring

On the motorcycle:

* make a new exhaust bracket so that the right-hand pillion footrest can go

On SCAMP:

* install latest bootrom, microcode
* install latest filesystem
* do a practice Advent of Code problem, check both `slc` and `slangi` are functioning correctly on real hardware

Other:

* demo of 3d-printed one-way mechanisms (involute gears, Geneva drive, others?)
* varnish the bauble
