## Surplusness equation

examining the relationship between "free space", "used space", and "total space", like if you're considering
making a disk 10% bigger but it gets you more than 10% more free space, because the used space stays the same;
but not specific to disks, it's a very general function (how wide are parking spaces? how wide is the shower? what's
the use in earning 5% more money? etc.)

Needs a better name.

If you have used U0 proportion of the total space (say 0.5), and the total space grows by factor G (say 2),
how much U1 of the new space have you used?

U1 = U0/G

If you have free F0 proportion of the total space (say 0.5), and the total space grows by factor G (say 2),
how much F1 of the new space have you used?

F1 = 1 - (1 - F0)/G

## Utility & Morality

* exchange rate between morality points and utility points (e.g. how much would I have to pay you to steal from an old lady if noone will ever find out?)
* diminishing marginal returns to utility, because of a maximum amount of utility points you can possibly make use of in one lifetime
* morality arbitrage, if you spend morality to earn utility which you then spend on others ("OK, Pay me to steal from the old lady and I'll donate all the money to charities", robbing Peter to pay Paul)


## Products vs Techniques

In the olden days people solved problems by knowing techniques. Now we solve problems by buying products.
What have we lost? What have we gained? Give examples.

## The decline of the physical realm

How everything in the physical world is getting worse. Roads are always closed, restaurants make you piss
about with QR codes, bins only collected every 3 weeks, etc.
