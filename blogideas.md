## Surplusness equation

examining the relationship between "free space", "used space", and "total space", like if you're considering
making a disk 10% bigger but it gets you more than 10% more free space, because the used space stays the same;
but not specific to disks, it's a very general function (how wide are parking spaces? how wide is the shower? what's
the use in earning 5% more money? etc.)

Needs a better name.

If you have used U0 proportion of the total space (say 0.5), and the total space grows by factor G (say 2),
how much U1 of the new space have you used?

U1 = U0/G

If you have free F0 proportion of the total space (say 0.5), and the total space grows by factor G (say 2),
how much F1 of the new space have you used?

F1 = 1 - (1 - F0)/G

## Utility & Morality

* exchange rate between morality points and utility points (e.g. how much would I have to pay you to steal from an old lady if noone will ever find out?)
* diminishing marginal returns to utility, because of a maximum amount of utility points you can possibly make use of in one lifetime
* morality arbitrage, if you spend morality to earn utility which you then spend on others ("OK, Pay me to steal from the old lady and I'll donate all the money to charities", robbing Peter to pay Paul)


## Products vs Techniques

In the olden days people solved problems by knowing techniques. Now we solve problems by buying products.
What have we lost? What have we gained? Give examples.

## The decline of the physical realm

How everything in the physical world is getting worse. Roads are always closed, restaurants make you piss
about with QR codes, bins only collected every 3 weeks, etc.

## The Douzieme gauge

In this post I'm going to explain what a Douzieme gauge is, show you one I made myself, and propose
a couple of ideas for high-precision measuring instruments using the Douzieme gauge principle.

* What is a Douzieme gauge?

It looks like this: [pic]

It is a historical watchmaker's tool. It is so niche that it doesn't currently have a Wikipedia page.
When was it invented? A "douzieme" is 1/12 of a "ligne", which is (about?) 2.25mm.

A Douzieme gauge uses leverage to expand the measurement at the jaws so that it can be shown next to
a larger scale.

* My Douzieme gauge

I made this one: [pic]

Mine has a 5-to-1 ratio between the distance at the pointer and the distance at the jaws. That means that
the 0.1mm graduations on the scale are 0.5mm apart.

I cut out one of the jaws on the CNC milling machine, and the other by hand with a bandsaw. It actually took less time
to make the cut with the bandsaw, but I did a worse job and it needed more tidying up with files, so swings and roundabouts really.

I couldn't work out how to do the spring at first, so I rifled through my toolbox and found a pair of spring-loaded circlip
pliers from which to copy the design: [pic]

I accidentally made one jaw thicker than the other at the pivot. D'oh.

And some examples of measuring things to test the accuracy.

* High-precision measuring instruments

We could make a "Douzieme Vernier caliper" or a "Douzieme micrometer". Include drawings.

The "Douzieme Vernier caliper" would be a Douzieme gauge with a Vernier scale.

The "Douzieme micrometer" would be a Douzieme gauge with a micrometer screw to expand the legs.

We would get 5x the precision of a normal Vernier caliper or micrometer, because of the Douzieme gauge leverage.
