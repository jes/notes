## Neural net images

Another idea I had was to do an initial training where it has just one picture, the same picture at every `z`
coordinate, and then after that has reached an acceptable quality level, then limit the first picture to `z=0`
and add the second picture at `z=1`.

But first I'm going to get a collection of images that are sort of "similar" to each other and make it learn them
all at different `z` coordinates. Another way of thinking of `z` is that it's `t`, i.e. you're giving it keyframes
and it's learning an animation.

Here's some F1 driver headshots, let's try these: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5379

I wonder if there's a better sort order? For example have the same uniforms together so that it has half a chance of
identifying "like" parts of the uniform and moving them over, instead of fading one out and fading the next in.

Looks interesting so far, needs a lot more training though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajeWBiwLKkw
