Things to look at on this today:

 * shaft collars on the adjacent arm shaft
 * one-piece bearings for remontoire so that it is always the correct spacing
 * adjust pallets

Something like this for remontoire bearings?

The horizontal spacing is 51.1mm, I think 51.0mm is the theoretical correct
distance for the gear spacing, but may need adjusting.

And then I think things to look at next time are:

 * how can I make the balance spring weaker but still support the weight?
 * longer drum, winding mechanism

Printed, installed:

First issue is it seems like the escape wheel shaft is no longer perpendicular to the
balance shaft, not sure why, can probably fix it most easily by moving the balance shaft.

Second issue is that the adjacent-arm shaft doesn't spin freely, I think it needs to
be further away. But maybe the easiest fix is to print a new pinion for it, slightly
smaller.

I'm actually going to try loading up the weight and see if it works as is.

It doesn't.

So now I've changed the "profile shift" on the pinion from -0.10 to -0.25, will print
it again. I think ideally the driving gear would have the "manual" tooth size reduction like
on the bigger gears, but quicker to do it this way and see if it works.
