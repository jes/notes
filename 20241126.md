## Encoder UI

This is now refactored into a bunch of separate files to make it easier to work with.

Also the moving averages now skip the first N points instead of averaging over a smaller
window.

## Temperature and pressure monitoring

How to do this?

Connecting anything up to the ESP32 is trouble, because the case doesn't have any room for
it, and besides I don't want to have to do any more dead-bug-style soldering on it.

So I want a separate device to measure temperature and pressure, and I'll take humidity
if easy as well.

Since I'm almost certainly going to be using a Raspberry Pi to run the data collection, I
don't mind if the sensor only works with a Pi and not with a normal PC.

But most of the Pi temperature sensors only have 0.5 deg. C precision, I want much better
than that.

I've ordered an "SHT85" sensor that supposedly has 0.1 deg. C precision, it looks like this:

I like that the board is necked down to provide a "heat break". In the past I have used
a temperature sensor that slowly rose over time as the electronics heated up, so this
should be an improvement. And probably I'll mount it on a wire to bring it some distance
from the Raspberry Pi, so that that isn't heating it up either.

This device gives humidity and temperature over I2C. So I'll probably want a second
device that gives barometric pressure.

And for pressure the best suggestion from ChatGPT was a "BMP390" which has precision
down to 0.03 hPa. So I've ordered one of those.

I also found a BMP180 in the drawer which I could get hooked up today just to make
a start.

I think the encoder backend will send temperature, pressure, etc. readings periodically,
and the UI will use the most recent value wherever it needs it (e.g. adding new period/amplitude
data points).

Then we add a plot of period vs temperature, period vs pressure, etc.
