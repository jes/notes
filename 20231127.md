## Stepper motor clock

I'm a bit confused about what sort of magnets I should be using. My notes say the CAD is intended for 8mm by 2mm magnets,
but the CAD has a hole that is 6.2mm in diameter.

It wants magnets that are **6mm by 2mm**, and they are not quite a press fit so they want a drop of superglue.

Next up is preparing the frame pieces.

I've made both backplane pieces and assembled the wheels and stepper motor. Mostly looks OK, but
the second wheel interferes with the third wheel spacer. The problem also exists in CAD, so it
is poor that I didn't already know about this issue:

Also:

 * the movement is quite tight generally, but doesn't seem to be the gears that are
   tight, maybe the bearings? maybe I should soak them in IPA?
 * the clearance hole I drilled on the second wheel is slightly too big, but I already knew about
   this, might get away with it anyway
 * the magnetic friction fit was originally quite slippery, but after I span it around with the drill
   for 10 seconds or so it became very grippy; have I worn chunks off the magnets or something? as long
   as it easy enough to set the hands I don't necessarily care
 * the spacers are too tight and some of them have cracked

So what am I going to do about the spacer? Probably have to make a thinner one. I want a 12.5mm long
piece of aluminium or brass, 6mm diameter, with a 5mm bore. While I'm at it maybe I should make all
of the spacers this way, as they are shoddy and have cracked.

So the plan is:

 * select wood for the dials, spraypaint white, wait for it to dry
 * remake the spacers in aluminium or brass, check how it works
 * cut the bamboo base piece to size
 * fit both base pieces (use electrical cover to set position)
 * fully assemble one movement with transformer etc.
 * lacquer the white, wait for it to dry
 * engrave the dials
 * spray dials black and immediately wipe off, wait for it to dry
 * cut dials out

## Garage

I think my ethernet cable is 10m and really wants to be 12m. For now I've strung it up diagonally, but I've ordered
a female-to-female plug so that I can extend it with a 2m cable and then pin it up properly.

I've put an MDF top on the computer desk: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5058

And started populating the tool wall: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5059

Update: no ethernet again :(. Even with it plugged in a bit closer to the fusebox. I have
one more option to get slightly closer to the fusebox once I have the cable extender,
and if that doesn't work then it'll have to be wifi.

## Regexes

I think we can probably do away with the postfix notation, and turn the AST into the NFA.
For that matter, it is probably easy enough to lose the AST and parse straight to the NFA.

But for now let's just amalgamate `regex` and `regex.tree-broken` so that we parse a normal regex
into a tree and then turn the tree into an NFA that we can run.

I've put the previous `regex` program in `regex.postfix-with-capture`.

Actually let's not get ahead of ourselves. I'm going to turn the AST into postfix first.

Turning the tree into postfix is pretty trivial, it turns out. However my capturing isn't working, I
was already a bit suspicious it was wrong, need to rethink it.

This series implements capturing in a NFA: https://www.abstractsyntaxseed.com/blog/regex-engine/implementing-a-nfa

He evaluates the NFA with backtracking :(. So he has missed Thompson's key contribution.

Even https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson's_construction talks about the method of turning a regex into
an NFA, rather than the method of evaluating the NFA, but it is the `O(nm)` method of evaluating the NFA that
is most important!

Rust has a regex engine called `PikeVM`, which is under the `regex_automata::nfa::thompson` package (? namespace? whatever),
and supports capturing groups.

Apparently this is all based on `re1`: https://code.google.com/archive/p/re1/

So this project contains a `thompsonvm()` as well as a `pikevm()`, and it looks like the `thompsonvm()`
supports capturing as well. Let's try and understand.

Ah, I misunderstood. The project has a general-purpose form for capturing groups, and `thompsonvm()` uses this
method to indicate whether or not the string matched the regex. It doesn't track capturing groups.

So let's look at the `pikevm()`. It is very short. Oh, Russ Cox has a web page about this as well:
https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html (and, wow, what a great web page it is).

> Submatching can be implemented in *both* backtracking and non-backtracking VMs. (Code doing this dates back to 1985, but I believe this article is the first written explanation of it.)

Aha, here is the key piece of information I was looking for:

> In Thompson's VM, `addthread` could limit the size of the thread lists to *n*, the
> length of the compiled program, by keeping only one thread with each possible
> 0PC. In Pike's VM, the thread state is larger—it includes the saved pointers
> too—but `addthread` can still keep just one thread with each possible PC. This is
> because the saved pointers do not influence future execution: they only record
> past execution. Two threads with the same PC will execute identically even if
> they have different saved pointers; thus only one thread per PC needs to be kept.

So the plan is we parse the regex into a tree, then turn the tree into VM code and
then evaluate the VM.

In SCAMP the VM code could ideally be machine code.

For now I'll just try to implement the `pikevm()` method.

Great! Got it working in `regex.pikevm`. Very good. It is 250 lines of perl,
but it could probably be a lot shorter, especially in SLANG because we'd collapse the hashes
into something less verbose.

The 250 lines are:

 * 30 lines: setup, usage
 * 75 lines: parsing the regex into an AST
 * 61 lines: turning the AST into a VM
 * 84 lines: running the Pike VM

And I'm pretty sure we can skip the AST step, and turn the regex straight into a VM. I think this is
good progress.
