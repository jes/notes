Printed a bracket to mount the binocular microscope on the lathe carriage.

Made a minimal testcase to show my issue with Matter.js and reported on github: https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/issues/1240 https://incoherency.co.uk/matterjs-test-case/

But actually, having made that test case, maybe that is an easier place to construct a model of the pallets, and then
when I get it to work without the erratic movements I can just copy it back to the main simulator project.
