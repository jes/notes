## Clock

The plan is to replace the 7-tooth lantern pinion with a 10-tooth ordinary pinion, and see
if the drive weight can be reduced below 7x M20 nuts.

## 500 error

Why is clockwatcher giving a 500 Internal Server Error when you try to view historical data?

The log has lots of:

    Error writing to database: table readings has no column named bmp390_temperature

The `CREATE TABLE` does add this column, so I guess just deleted `readings.db` and restart.

And historical data looks to be working again as well now.
