## Remontoire

So the plan today is to make a first attempt at a Korfhage-style remontoire.

See http://www.my-time-machines.net/korfhage_remontore.htm

But I'll put it directly on the shaft with the escape wheel, instead of on a
shaft that is then geared to the escape wheel, because I don't see the use in having
the extra stage of gear meshing in between.

So I need to "split" my escape wheel shaft between the pinion and the escape wheel,
and put the bevel gears in between, and also have another shaft
geared off the pinion side, spinning faster, to catch the arm on the remontoire.

If I want it to wind up every quarter of a turn, and the arm will catch the remontoire
after a quarter of a turn, then the arm needs to spin 4x as fast.

The first question is how do you make bevel gears in FreeCAD?
One possibility would be to make 2 PartDesign InvoluteGear profiles, shift one up
by a few mm, and make the upper one have smaller modulus, and loft between them?

Another possibility is to use the Gears workbench, but I tried to install it and it hasn't
worked.

Another possibility is to pad up a PartDesign InvoluteGear with a draft angle.

I think the taper angle thing is not right. I don't want a flat gear that gets narrower
as it goes upwards, I want it to stay the same size, but project on a line that goes at
22.5 degrees.

So maybe I try that? Make an InvoluteGear, pad it, then make a datum line from
the root of one of the teeth, upwards at 22.5 degrees from vertical, leaning towards the origin.
Then draw the profile of the tooth, pocket it along the datum line, PolarPattern around
Z?

No, the tooth profile will be skewed.

OK, so I do the same thing, but start with a flat disc instead of a padded InvoluteGear,
and to reference the tooth shape I make a flat InvoluteGear and tilt it by 22.5 degrees.

Scratch all that. I uninstalled and reinstalled the Gears workbench and it is working,
so I'll use that.

Actually, update: let's make it rewind every eighth of a turn instead of every quarter.

cos(45 deg.) = 0.71, cos(22.5 deg.) = 0.92

If it rewinds a quarter of a turn at a time (from -45 deg. to +45 deg.),
the torque will vary by a lot more than if it only rewinds an eighth at a time.

It might be a better idea to make it rewind by some proportion that doesn't evenly divide
the circle, by the "hunting tooth" principle.

OK, I have this: https://img.incoherency.co.uk/5808

So the weight will hang off the existing ratcheting drum, and turn the existing big gear
that is on the same shaft. That then turns the existing roller lantern pinion, which
previously was connected directly to the escape wheel shaft.

The roller lantern pinion turns its shaft, which turns the first bevel gear, which both raises
up the middle bevel gear, and turns the adjacent shaft 8x as fast. So after an eighth of a
turn, the arm on the adjacent shaft hits the protrusion from the middle bevel
gear, which stops it from going any further.

The middle bevel gear is trying to fall down under its weight, which makes the final bevel
gear turn, which turns the escape wheel. Once the escape wheel has done an eighth of a turn,
the middle bevel gear will have fallen far enough for the arm to unlock, which allows the
drive weight to start falling again, until the adjacent shaft has done another complete turn
and the arm is again locked against the protrusion of the middle bevel gear, etc. until
you run out of string.

I have the drive weight and the adjacent shaft on the same centre line so that I can use
the same physical shaft for both of them, and just let the adjacent gear spin freely
on the shaft, to simplify the frame.

So now I just need a frame to hold it all, and maybe something to allow me to attach weights to
the middle bevel gear's shaft.

???

Not very elegant, but it might do for now. I really need to build a metal frame, but I
think I prefer the flexibility of bolting 3d-printed parts together for now.

I'm just going to print all of these parts and see how I get on.

It'll be 2 print jobs of 2 hours each. I'm going to have a break now during the first
print job, and capture a "control" trace during the second one. Then fit the remontoire
and see if it works & what difference it makes.

Not sure why the amplitude was rising over time. Maybe the balance pivots are too tight
and it was freeing up by wearing them away? I won't mess with them though. To compare
like-for-like I'll try to leave it as much the same as possible when fitting the
remontoire.

Darn, I have to cut some length off the escape wheel shaft, which means I'm going to have
to much about re-depthing the escapement and re-aligning the escape wheel. Never mind.

I need the escape wheel shaft to be about **172 mm**, the remontoire driving shaft to be about
**100 mm**, the remontoire adjacent shaft to be about **140mm**, and some arbitrary length for the weight to hang off the side of the remontoire.

My existing winding drum shaft is almost exactly 172 mm, so I'll use that for the
new escape wheel shaft.

Oops, I realised it's not going to work.

The 8:1 gear reduction is the wrong way around, so the remontoire will wind up for
*8 turns* before stopping, instead of one eighth of a turn. I can put it together but manually
stop and release the remontoire just to see if there are any other issues.

Also I'm out of PAHT-CF shaft collars.

Whoa, actually... do you even need the intermittent rewinding at all?? What if you just
have a "stop" for the weight, and let the train continuously try to wind it up? It will
always be pushing down on the escapement, and will always be raised up by the train.
It's like a remontoire that rewinds on every single tick. What is the downside?

Anyway, I have put it all together, minus the "adjacent gear" with its remontoire-catching arm.

There is too much friction in all of my pivots and gear meshing for 3x M20 nuts to be able
to wind it up, but if I wind it up by hand it seems to work.

Oh! The downside of the "just continuously unlock the remontoire" idea is that while the
remontoire weight is locked, the train can transmit torque directly through the middle
bevel gear to the escapement, so it no longer detaches the escapement from the train. OK.

I have freed up some of the tight spots and now it is just about running with 3x M20 nuts
plus a small allen key.
It doesn't have enough torque to keep the remontoire wound up, but as the weight falls
down the torque required to wind it up drops, and then it does wind up, so it is almost
working correctly, it just rewinds at a random point instead of every eighth of an escape
wheel turn.

It is spending some portion of its time with the middle bevel gear wedged against the frame,
so transmitting torque directly through the bevel gear to the escapement, but most of the time
it is just running off the remontoire weight.

So earlier today, with no remontoire, it ranged over **25 degrees* and about **4.75 ms**.

With the extremely crude remontoire, it ranged over about **18 degrees** and about **4.75 ms**.
But some of that could be dismissed as "ramp-up", if we only look at the data from
t=500s onwards, it is **7 degrees** and **1.75 ms**, which is a big improvement.

And the period-amplitude relationship appears to be a lot tighter than it was before. Perhaps
it is just that the rate of change of amplitude is lower, because the hunting amplitude
problem is basically gone.

There *is* still a hunting amplitude in the non-averaged data:

That is because the remontoire weight is falling quite far down before getting rewound, and
isn't getting properly decoupled from the drive weight. I think if this were actually working
as intended it would be even better.

Issues are:

 * need clearance in the frame piece for the bevel gear to wind up
 * parts that rub against frames or other parts need washer features
 * obviously the 8:1 gear ratio is backwards
 * want to use proper ball bearings instead of just running shafts in 3d prints

## Tare on server-side

I got Cursor to do this, and recorded a demo video to impress jrn.

## More balance weights

Now trying with 3x M12 bolts on the balance wheel. Adding the first 2 bolts took the period
up from ~2 seconds to ~4 seconds, so I think a 3rd should make it ~5 seconds? If you
assume a marginal bolt adds 1 second to the period?

Seems to be about 4.75 seconds.

I've added some random plastic parts to the remontoire as a bit of extra torque for the
escapement, and added a smaller M20 nut for extra drive weight.

It's now swinging far enough to actually experience recoil from the varying resting surface.

One cool thing about the remontoire is the long arm sticking out of it gives a very amplified
view of the motion of the escape wheel.

I messed it up by mucking about with the remontoire around t=1200s, but apart from that it
stayed within about 2 ms period and about 8 degrees amplitude.

## TODO

 * fix the remontoire, see "Issues are" above
 * more gearing stages
 * stiffer frame
 * store all datalogging persistently, and allow viewing static data from some specified time window
 * switch to datalogging from Raspberry Pi, hook up the SHT85, log temperature, pressure, humidity
