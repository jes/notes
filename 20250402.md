This has been running for over 36 hours without stopping, but
I connected up the clockwatcher at some point yesterday after it
had already been running overnight and part of the day.

The amplitude drops precipitously at one point, I'm guessing the remontoire didn't rewind properly.

I think the plan is:

 * pour some resin or something into the weight tube, to add weight and prevent the balls from spilling if it breaks
 * soak all the bearings in IPA, because I know some of them haven't been
 * make better bearing blocks for the remontoire
 * make better bearing block for the "middle" wheel
 * print the balance shaft bearings in the other orientation
 * longer barrel
 * winding mechanism
 * face, hands
 * legs
 * perspex panels

## Isoform core problems

Remaining core problems:

 * try making `VoxelNode` just classify voxels as "in" or "out" and then propagate distances from there - so that we can use it for renormalisation
 * targeting fillets/chamfers
 * type custom SDFs in some Peptide DSL
 * isomorphism between tree view and a human-friendly text representation (and maybe use this representation to save your file?)
 * gears, text, helical extrusions
 * use sparse octree and interval arithmetic for marching cubes in mesh export
 * can we use bounding boxes in unions etc. to say that if the distance to the bounding box of the next child is greater than the current minimum distance to the surface, then we don't even bother evaluating the next child?
 * let Peptide functions return "structs" instead of just scalar values and vectors
 * pass Lipschitz constant separately from distance field, so that it can be used to adjust step factor without also messing up the mean distance
 * select a node in the tree by clicking on the surface (have the SDF "struct" tell you which primitive's `uniqueId` the distance came from)

## Peptide structs

You can get most of the way here by passing a plain JavaScript object
that has multiple Peptide expressions in it.

The problem is that when you turn it in to JS/GLSL code, you get a scalar
out at the end instead of a struct.

So then let's imagine `P.struct({a: ..., b: ..., c: ...})` where
all the "..." are Peptide expressions. In JS code we can simply
return an object with fields that are the evaluations of the
expressions. In GLSL we will need to declare the struct somewhere.

Probably the only struct we need to declare is the one that is
finally returned. Any intermediate structs are better off just
disappearing into the expression tree.

So another function `P.field(struct, name)` would select out the
named field from the struct.

And for the SDFs we'd want fields:

 * distance (float)
 * colour (vec3)
 * uniqueId (float)

`TreeNode.min`/`max` can automatically select `uniqueId`, and interpolate
colour. But everything else that has to deal with a child node is now
going to have to laboriously track the `colour` and `uniqueId`, and
extract the `distance` separately.

So another way is we could add "metadata" to Peptide nodes. And
when you construct a node it will automatically inherit metadata from
its first child that has any, but let you override it if you want.

Primitives will have to explicitly set their metadata. Modifiers of 1
child can probably ignore it completely. Combinators may have to combine
them sensibly, but may get it for free if `TreeNode.min`/`max` does it.

And then at code generation, sometimes we'll want the struct with
all the metadata, and sometimes we'll just want the primary value.
Maybe just always give the struct, and you have to get the primary value
if that's what you want?

Carrying metadata around statically won't work, because it won't allow
selecting between nodes at runtime.

So we basically do want the explicit `P.struct` thing.

And I think `P.field` needs to look "through" the struct, so that
a tree that looks up fields in structs can still be handled properly
by the `simplify()` code that assumes the children are all referenced
by `left`/`right`/`third`.

And then we'll say the only things that you can do with structs is
access their fields and evaluate them as a root node. And then nothing
else cares about it. And since "accessing their fields" just shortcuts
the `struct` and gives back the field directly, the only place a
`struct` node can be is the root of the tree.

So then do we special-case `struct`s in code generation so that it
knows about all of the children? Or do we say that any node can have
arbitrarily-many children, just so that code generation handles it
automatically?

Maybe we make the calling code specifically know about structs, so
that it can declare them etc. in the surrounding GLSL code? Or at
least know what type name to use?

OK, I have `P.struct`/`P.field` working in the "interpreted" case,
with a unit test checking that common subexpression elimination
works.

Now how to handle structs for compiled code?

What I want to get is SSA code that computes each field individually
and then return a struct of them all at the end.

So probably I "hide" the `struct` from the code generation, but
remember which value corresponds to which field, and then if the root
node was a struct, I construct it and return it right at the end,
otherwise just return the last value.

Great, that's working for JS code. Now need JS intervals, GLSL,
GLSL intervals.

For propagating material information (starting with just colour),
I think we'll let each `TreeNode` optionall set a "colour" vec3, and
if it is set then its `peptide()` will overwrite the colour generated
by `makePeptide()`, otherwise it will leave it blank.

And maybe primitives will always have to pick the default colour if not
set?

Actually to start with let's always just propagate the child node's
colour, and make a `ColourNode` which overwrites it, similar to
how `TransformNode` is its own node type but will eventually be
common to all.

But I'm getting ahead of myself, still need GLSL structs.

GLSL has no way for me to return a populated struct without knowing
the name of the struct. So I think the caller will need to tell
me the name of the struct if the expression is a struct.

OK, great success, I now have working tests for all combinations
of JavaScript/GLSL and normal/interval mode, with structs.

## Object colours

The first useful thing to do with structs is let objects have different
colours.

So that will mean changing the way Peptide is used in `TreeNode` so
that instead of just yielding a distance, it instead yields a struct
with:

 * distance: float
 * color: vec3

We'll accept the American spelling of "color" to make it easier for
Claude.

And then:

 * `TreeNode`'s `getSDF()` will wrap the Peptide expression in `P.field(expr, 'distance')` so that it works like it currently does
 * the shader code generation will have to pick a name for the struct, and then use the colour for rendering
 * `TreeNode.min`/`max` will have to choose/blend colours
 * ever `TreeNode` has to return a Peptide struct instead of float
 * primitives will use a default colour
 * add a `ColorNode` for changing object colours
