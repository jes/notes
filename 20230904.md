## Escapement simulator

I've added some springs to pull the anchor towards the centre position, and configurable mass on the anchor - it's effectively
now a balance wheel, although not rendered as such.

Next steps are:

* render an actual balance wheel
* allow separation of the balance wheel from the anchor, so I can compare the amplitudes
* calibrate units for the "arbitrary units" fields
* make pivot friction adjustable (?)
* make a 3d printed model of an escapement with the anchor directly on the wheel, and another of the same except the anchor is separate from the wheel, and compare the performance
