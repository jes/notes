I wondered if making the wire shorter would reduce the propensity to flutter, because that effectively makes it into a stiffer spring.

Yes! Much better now. Also I found that reducing the drive weight really helps, because that's another way you can ensure that the impulse
is delivered over a longer period of time.

You want the impulse to take a long time so that the spring has moved around and won't "snap back" once the tooth is released.
You can make it take longer by either making the spring stiffer, or by reducing the amount of force you're applying.

It basically works now, except that it loses energy with every cycle.
